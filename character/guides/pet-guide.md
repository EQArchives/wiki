# Pet Guide

> This pet guide has been adapted several times from its original [source](http://samanna.net/eq.general/pets.shtml), but tries to be as accurate as possible for most cases.  Where information is known about specific eras or patch messages, it will be annotated.  Those knowledgeable about each class should make corrections with respect to specific expansions or time periods. {.is-info}

## General Pet Info

### Level Variance

All pets summoned during the "classic" time period (i.e. the first few expansions) were subject to level variance, meaning that a level within the range specified is randomly selected when you summon a pet. Reagents are cheap and you should be carrying multiple stacks of them at all times, so invariably you want to re-summon until you get a max pet, whether soloing or in a group. The added damage and HPs of your max pet will be well worth while over the life of your group and especially if you're soloing. This is true for all pet classes.

The only way to be sure you have a max pet is to look at its damage output. At some levels you may be able to con the pet, but later on, your pet will always be blue, so its max hit is the only real clue to its level. If he's not hitting for max, recycle it. 

The spell, [Reclaim Energy](https://www.eqarchives.com/spells/view/331), is your friend. There are numerous clicky items in game with this effect. The mage focus items can be clicked from inventory and as such used by all pet classes.

### Pet Weapons

If a weapon's damage is greater than the pets innate damage, the pets maximum hit will increase. This maximum hit follows [the standard damage tables by level](https://wiki.project1999.com/Game_Mechanics#Melee_damage). For instance, capped at 21 for a DMG: 10 weapon at low levels. It is worth noting, however, that after level 10, pets don't necessarily follow the same damage cap progression. A level 16 necromancer pet with a 22 damage can hit for 44, for example.

While any pet class can benefit from giving their pet a weapon, Enchanters have the ability to retrieve pet weapons by letting their charmed pet break free of the charm and then be slain. Necromancers can do the same for undead mobs. Depending on your confidence level, you can also equip your charmed pet with items that reduce magic resist such as the Adamantite Band, thus allowing for longer charm times. You could also give your pet a haste item so it could benefit from worn haste, as well as the haste from any magical spell.

This pet-gearing is something that can continue until you are dealing with rather expensive items, such as the Steel Hilted Flint Dagger. There is a balance of risk and reward to equipping such items, and is quite thrilling. An item like the Staff of Undead Legions performs powerfully in a dungeon with lots of undead, such as Karnor's Castle. Woe to the enchanter or necromancer who loses thousands of platinum because of the loss of their pet. Even with forewarning, I have seen healers neglect to save the lives of these expensive puppets, as they have their own understanding of priorities in an emergency. Be mindful of how much you are willing to risk, and if you are in a pick-up group or a trusted static of friends.

Beyond increases of DPS, there is also a benefit to equipping your pet with more bizarre armaments. Giving your pet an instrument from a bard guild, such as a Mandolin, gives a clear visual to all melee members of the party which mob is the dedicated charm pet, and to ignore it.

One trick I have found is that pets can actually **triple wield** if you give the items to your pet in a specific order. This can help maximize your pets DPS, especially as a young Necromancer or Magician by having a high damage weapon for your pet to wield. By giving your pet a Secondary slot **only** item, such as a Torch **first**, and giving your pet a two-handed weapon **second**, the pet will equip the 2 handed weapon in its primary slot while retaining its offhand item, and dual wield both.

This opens a horizon for pet weapon combinations and ability to show your style off to the group. You will get comments if your pet is the froglok with a Sarnak Ceremonial Sword and a Horn. Beyond displaying immense swag, some two handers make for nice pet weapons in this manner due to their procs, such as the inexpensive Stormwood Battle Staff, or if you plan on having your pet tanking while a cleric heals it, a Axe of the Slayers can reduce some of the damage taken. Keep an eye out for fun two handed weapons for your pets! Remember that your pet itself needs to be a high enough level to proc its weapon.

There are a number of weapons that have been identified as effective pet weapons due to an increase in DPS through proc effects, one of the most recognized being the Deadwood Stave. However, be aware that these proc effects may also break roots currently applied to their target; be aware of how your group composition is using its crowd control. Below is a list of some popular (and less well-known) pet weapons.

#### One handed weapons

- Wakizashi of the Frozen Skies - 80pt DD at level 20. Non-lore, low-level, semi-long quest
- Deadwood Stave
- Gnoll Hide Lariat - the classic double edged sword - be careful when your pet breaks charm and keep your magic resistance high.
- Goblin Skull Crusher - another stunning weapon that is not Lore.
- Dagger of Dropping
- Master Wu's Trance Stick
- Serrated Bone Dirk
- Wintry Club
- Kunzar Ku'juch
- Staff of Undead Legions
- Steel Hilted Flint Dagger
- Coldain Crossbow

#### Two handed weapons

- Axe of the Slayers
- Sarnak Ceremonial Sword - Very fashionable!
- A Mithril Two-Handed Sword - which also confers a haste bonus.
- Stormwood Battle Staff
- Kromrif Laborer Pick
- Rod of Lamentation
- Firerune Brand
- Swarmcaller - adds a Slow proc

#### Offhand items

- Torch
- Mandolin
- Horn

There is another page dedicated to pet gear [here](https://wiki.project1999.com/Charmed_Pet_Gear).

### Attack Delay

A pet's attack delay *is not* affected by the delay on a given weapon (it was in 1999, and Magician pets were not able to wield weapons at that time). However, weapon slot choice is determined by delay (i.e. lower delay item will replace one with a higher delay).

**Pet attack speed starts at 3 seconds for the lowest level pets and gets faster for higher level pets, with the Magician epic pet having the fastest attack speed of any pet (1.65 seconds).**

### Dual Wielding

In classic, pets must be given two 1H weapons in order to dual wield. Pets gain innate dual wield at level 39 (based on forum reports, needs confirming). Dual wielding pets will eventually stop accepting 2H weapons or shields (reported to be in late 20s or 30s, needs confirming).

### Pet Armor

Pets can equip items in these slots: primary weapon, secondary weapon, ranged weapon, shoulder, legs, chest, head, foot, hands, arms, back, face, and neck. Additionally, they can equip a single wrist slot, and a single ear slot. Pets cannot equip no drop items. Pets do not follow race or class restrictions on items, which makes for some interesting equipment choices such as the Coldain Crossbow. Pets will gain stats from items, but note that armor slot choice is determined by AC (i.e. 16 AC +0 HP item will overwrite a 14 AC +50 HP item).

**Note:** A simple HP ring test determined that charmed pets currently benefit from two rings and are not limited to a single ring.

While any pet can benefit from equipping armor, classes that can charm a pet will benefit the most from this mechanic as they can receive the equipment bestowed to their charm target by breaking the charm and killing it. The two main bonuses charmers most often seek to bestow to their DPS machines are [Haste](https://wiki.project1999.com/Haste_Guide) to make usage of worn haste bonuses and a reduced magic resistance, thus allowing for longer charm times.

#### Common magic de-resistance items:

- Adamantite Band
- Rusty Spiked Shoulderpads
- A complete list of negative MR items can be found [here](https://wiki.project1999.com/Category:Negative_MR)
- A list of pet gear can be found [here](https://wiki.project1999.com/Charmed_Pet_Gear)

Because pets do not follow race or class restrictions, I have seen charmers carry a Tolapumj's Robe for their pets as it confers a hefty 36% haste bonus. Other items with a comparable haste bonus are quite pricey. For a full list of haste items you can give to your pet, view [this table](https://wiki.project1999.com/Haste_Guide#Permanent_Haste_Items).

### Pets and Experience

In order to receive full experience for a kill solo, you need to do more than 50% of the damage to the mob. If your pet out-damages you, it will take 50% of the experience away from the kill. This is a major change from the previous system, in which you only needed to do a single point of damage to the mob in order to get full experience. If you are grouped, you and your group will get full experience from the kill, regardless of how much damage the pet does. (Implemented: [Oct 23 2011 Patch](https://www.project1999.com/forums/showthread.php?t=52390))

When doing less damage to a mob than your pet, in solo play, the 50% experience penalty can be avoided by removing your pet from the mob's aggro list *before* delivering the finishing blow to the mob. For example, this can be achieved in the following ways:

- The pet dies or is otherwise removed from the game.
- **Enchanter:** in case of a charmed pet, you can break charm on the pet before killing off the mob. No need to actually kill the formerly charmed pet, in this case, but it is a common practice among Enchanters to do so.
- **Enchanter:** casting Memory Blur on the mob. However, it is not easy to make sure the spell has succeeded (one technique: wait for next tick and check how much HP the mob regenerates; a large HP regeneration indicates the mob is out of combat and thus the spell succeeded).

### Pet tracking

The `/pet attack <something>` command can be used to check if there are NPCs up in the zone. If the NPC is up, the pet will emote 'Attacking <something> Master.' If the NPC isn't up, no message is emoted. It's good practice to put `/pet back off` in the last line of your macro, so that if the NPC comes into range of your pet, it won't actually attack it. This method won't necessarily tell you where an NPC is, or how many of them, just if they're up in the zone.

Pet tracking was nerfed in the [June 1st 2025 patch](https://www.project1999.com/forums/showthread.php?t=441099) -- v61 client

### Pros and Cons of the Elements

As long as EQ has been around, the pros and cons of the mage pets has been a constant source of discussion. People have their individual play styles and the pets allow for a bit of customization depending on what you're looking for. ([source](http://www.xalmat.com/eqsummoners.com-old/eq1/pets-library.html))

#### EARTH
- Has the most hit points of any of the elementals for its level
- Casts a root spell
- Has a relatively high disease resistance
- Considered the "tank" pet
- Good option for soloing due to its ability to root-tank while you nuke

#### WATER
- 2nd highest amount of hit points among elementals of the same level
- Faster health regeneration
- Has a very high poison resistance
- Casts an ice damage spell
- Best DPS pet when not tanking

#### AIR
- Slightly fewer hit points than a water elemental of the same level
- Casts a 3-5 second stun ([ref](http://www.project1999.com/forums/showthread.php?t=43268))
- Has a relatively high cold resistance
- Goes invisible when idle
- Good alternative for grouping due to stuns and less chance of accidental aggro when invisible
- The only magician pet that can be cast in Plane of Sky

#### FIRE
- Has the fewest hit points of any elemental for its level
- Casts a fire damage spell
- Has a relatively high fire resistance
- Casts a self-only damage shield that is far stronger than what you can cast for a given level
- Excellent choice for soloing due to the damage shield
- Slightly lower melee DPS due to lack of kick/bash

#### MONSTER SUMMONING
- Summons a pet with the model of a random NPC from the zone you're currently in
- High hit points, roughly on par with an earth pet of the same level
- Unaffected by focus items
- Does not gain unique attacks or abilities based on appearance
  - Monster Summoning I pets have an innate fire DD
- You can summon a dragon named Gabartik. Who cares if you have to DS it yourself?!

Generally monster summoning has a chance to give you a pet model from any non-playable race mob in the zone. In Sol A, for example, you can summon a clockwork pet, but you can't summon a gnome. Some models are extremely rare and may take many attempts to successfully "capture" them.

There are also some easter egg type models that are quite unexpected. Dagnor's Cauldron has a Faydedar model buried in the zone file. Other expected models, such as Quillmane in South Karana or Terrorantula in South Ro, don't seem to be summonable or are insanely rare (over 1,200 attempts).

The summoned monster pets are largely a novelty and help take the boredom away when farming in lower level zones. Who doesn't love to watch a snow bunny slaughter the Eastern Wastes giant fort? For serious adventuring, you will want to stick with your situational elemental pets.

#### EPIC
- Essentially a combination of all of the elementals upgraded and wrapped into one
- Has by far the highest hit points of any summoned pet in the game
- Hits very hard and quite fast
- Casts a 50 point damage shield
- Casts a 143 DD spell (cold-based)
- Casts an 84 DD stun
- Magician Epic Pets will no longer enrage at low health. Minor changes to runspeed and magic resistance. ([ref](http://www.project1999.org/forums/showthread.php?s=78bd0777f70413af096e828777dac5f3&t=114944))

### Chain Casting

At some point in a mage's life, fluffy will not take the hits like he used to. The pet heal spells, although great for soloing at lower levels, do not keep pace with fluffy's hps or the damage output of mobs. Therefore it becomes necessary for an alternate strategy: chain casting, which is the summoning of multiple pets in succession to kill a creature. At lower levels, the mana cost of pets and the cost of reagents makes this less feasible (and unnecessary due to your pet being strong enough to take the hits). However, at higher levels the mana cost of summoning pets drops (in addition to naturally dropping relative to your mana pool as you level), making it more cost effective to recast your pet rather than try and heal it.

Unfortunately, the way agro current works on P99, this strategy is not very effective. When a pet dies, all of the hate that it built up seems to be applied directly to the caster (instead of "lost"). This means that a newly summoned pet will have very little chance of peeling the mob off of the caster. This has been reported as a bug, but has yet to be acknowledged as one (as of 6/23/20).

### Focus Items

The lesser focus items (Torch of Alna, Shovel of Ponz, Broom of Trilon, and Stein of Ulissa) are quested from the Temple of Solusek Ro, and provide the spell-level 4-49 pets with increased size and hit points. The rule of thumb is that a focus item will give a pet the hit points of the next-most durable pet (fire -> air -> water -> earth), or roughly a 25% increase.

The greater focus items (Staff of Elemental Mastery: Water, Staff of Elemental Mastery: Fire, Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth, Staff of Elemental Mastery: Air) are obtained from high-end mobs and quests. In addition to the same change in appearance and hit points as their lesser counterparts, these staves provide a +1 level bonus to all summoned pets from spell levels 46-60. This allows for pets that can exceed the hit points, melee, and spell damage listed in the tables. The +1 level is added to the RNG of the level of pet you would have summoned. When you finish casting the summon pet spell, RNG will determine the level of pet you summoned in that pet spell's level range. If using the focus item, the pet's level will be RNG+1.

As an example, the Greater Vocaration: Water pet has a level range of 44-48. When you cast that spell, at the end of the cast RNG determines the pet level to be level 48. If you are using a focus item for that pet type, it adds +1 to the RNG so the pet would be level 49. A focused max level Greater Vocaration: Water pet will hit for 60, backstab for 210, and nuke for 118.

### Notes

- All levels in the table besides *spell level* refer to the pet's actual level, not the caster's.
- Ranges in the tables refer to minimum and maximum *pet level* for the column. For example: 85-95 HP for the Elementalkin: Earth means that a level 4 Earth pet will have 85 HP while a level 6 Earth pet will have 95.
- All values and ranges are for unfocused pets.
- On P99 Green, I noticed the low level fire pets have far more hp regen than is listed here in the tables. I used a brazier of elemental summoning on my level one necromancer and it gave me a level 10 pet. I confirmed this by its damage output. It naturally regenerated 22% of its hp per tick. With a health pool of 130 HP, that's approximately 29 HP per tick versus the 6 listed here. I don't know if this is unique to fire pets, but if it is this makes them hugely more valuable when leveling prior to 39 when all pets obtain fast regen.

## Necromancer Pets

### Focus Item

The only pet focus item that Necromancers can obtain is the Encyclopedia Necrotheurgia. Similar to the Magician pet focus items, this focus item makes the pet larger in size. It also provides a +1 level bonus to all summoned pets from spell levels 46-60. This allows for pets that can exceed the hit points, melee, and spell damage listed in the tables. The +1 level is added to the RNG of the level of pet you would have summoned. When you finish casting a pet spell, RNG will determine the level of pet you summoned in that pet's level range. If using the focus item for that pet, the pet's level will be RNG+1.

As an example, the Emissary of Thule pet has a level range of 43-47. When you cast that spell, at the end of the cast RNG determines the pet level to be level 47. If you are using the focus item, it adds +1 to the RNG so the pet would be level 48.

### Notes

- Abilities listed in the **Pet Skills** column apply to all subsequent pets, unless otherwise noted.

This pet is not very useful as a standard pet. Some Druids use it together with clicky Reclaim Energy items as a way to store mana. (It is a good guard pet in low level zones while afk) The above stats were collected from a live server and may be inaccurate if there were ever any updates pertaining to this pet.

## Pet Commands

### Command: /pet follow me, or /pet guard me

**UI Button:** Follow

**Effect:** puts the pet in Follow mode. This is the initial mode of a newly summoned pet. This command will overwrite /pet sit and /pet guard here and force the pet to follow its master.

### Command: /pet guard here

**UI Button:** Guard

**Effect:** puts the pet in Guard mode.

**Detail:** pet will become "parked" at its current location, contrary to the command wording it will not automatically attack any MOB, unless said MOB attacks its master.

**Special Note:** A pet under /pet guard here will face the nearest NPC, including invisible mobs, traps, horses, and Eye of Zomms.

### Command: /pet sit down

**UI Button:** Sit

**Effect:** puts the pet in Sit mode.

**Detail:** works exactly like the /pet guard here command with a few minor exceptions, low level pets will regen slightly faster. Once pets get their innate regen boost in the low 30's this additional regen becomes inconsequential.

The command /pet sit down will overwrite the command /guard, meaning that after it kills a mob it will follow its master rather than returning to the point where /pet sit was issued.

**Special Note:** /pet sit will toggle the pet's sit state, whereas /pet sit down will force the pet to sit.

### Command: /pet attack

**UI Button:** Attack

**Effect:** places the owners current target onto the pet's Hate List, and ends /pet hold.

**Detail:** pet will temporarily forget all prior commands and attempt to attack the target at the top of his hate list. /pet attack does not place the target at the top of the pets hate list, it just makes the pet attack the mob at the top of his hate list. The pet will not forget targets it already hates. It will not "forget" movement states, such as follow or guard, it will just temporarily ignore them as he attempts to attack his target. After the mob dies, the pet will return to his previous guard point, follow, or sit down, as previously commanded. The pet may be sidetracked however if another MOB begins to attack him before he has engaged the target OR if another MOB is doing significantly more damage to the pet thus generating enough aggro to make the pet switch targets.

**Special Note:** you may also use the alternative version of this command /pet kill

**PvP Note:** unless Player versus Player is enabled, you cannot add a player or a player charmed NPC to a pet's Hate List.

### Command: /pet kill name

**Effect:** takes whatever would be selected by the command /target name and puts it at the top of the pet's Hate List.

**Detail:** for example assume King Tormax was within range for you to /target King Tormax the command /pet kill King Tormax will order the pet to attack King Tormax regardless of what you currently have targeted. Originally a zone wide command, it was reduced to only work within the same range of the /target command.

### Command: /pet back off

**UI Button:** Back

**Effect:** empties the pet's Hate List, causing it to stop attacking.

**Detail:** while this will clear the pets hate list, if a mob attacks the pet again after this command is given it will begin attacking the mob again. This is a particular problem in areas with mobs casting large AE's. Temple of Veeshan is the most common example.

### Command: /pet taunt off

**UI Button:** Taunt

**Effect:** disables pet taunting, that is the pet will not taunt during fights.

**Detail:** this command very helpful on raids or other such group encounters where summoning MOBs are involved. However, in solo situations you should generally leave taunt enabled.

**Special Note:** if you omit the "off" portion of the command it will toggle the pets taunt mode (i.e. if it is on it will switch it off, and vice-versa)

### Command: /pet taunt on

**UI Button:** Taunt

**Effect:** enables pet taunting.

**Detail:** generally recommended for solo situations only.

**Special Note:** if you omit the "on" portion of the command it will toggle the pets taunt mode (i.e. if it is on it will switch it off, and vice-versa)

### Command: /pet leader

**Effect:** the pet will /say My leader is Doofus Da'Magi.

**Detail:** This command can be used by any player to target a pet and identify its owner.

### Command: /pet get lost

**UI Button:** Go Away

**Effect:** Instantly kills your pet.

**Detail:** This will instantly kill your pet, and is one of the essential commands for a technique known as chain-petting.

**Special Note:** This command is zone-wide and will kill your pet anywhere in the zone, regardless of distance from its master.

### Command: /pet health

**UI Button:** The Pet window itself

**Effect:** Displays your pet's current health percentage and buff list in the chat window.

**Detail:** This command instantly displays the current status of your pet, showing its HP percentage and current buffs/debuffs it currently has.

> This command displays the pet's health faster than the UI can update, and is very useful when timing is critical.{.is-info}

### Command: /pet target

**Effect:** Targets your pet.

**Detail:** This command clears your current target and replaces it with your pet. This is very useful for macros. However, it's often faster to simply hit the F1 key twice to target your pet.

> This command will target special pets that borrow the name of their master (i.e. Xalmat's pet) instead of your summoned pet (Flurfy's warder, Jonartik, etc). Use with caution when using such pets.{.is-info}

### Command: /pet as you were

**Effect:** Clears your pet's command list

**Detail:** This tells your pet to revert to a free state. If the pet is currently under /pet follow, or /pet guard me, it will revert to a /pet sit state. If it is chasing an NPC, and /pet as you were, followed by /pet back off is issued, the pet will continue off in its direction of travel. This command does not break /pet hold.

### Command: /pet hold

> Not available prior to the [Shadows of Luclin](/expansions/shadows_of_luclin) expansion. This command is only available to level 59 or higher pet classes who have obtained the Alternate Ability (aka an "AA skill") in the Pet Discipline.{.is-info}

**Effect:** causes the pet to be Held, i.e. it ignores its Hate List and goes into Free mode, resuming its regular movement (either follow, guard, or sit).

**Detail:** this command does not clear the pets hate list, the pet will remain "held" until you give it an attack command at which time it will attempt to attack the target at the top of its hate list. It is recommended you add the following line after /pet hold in a macro: /pet back off to ensure your pets hate list is clear. A pets hate list is frozen while it is "held", which means it does not add anyone or MOB to its hate list even if attacked.
