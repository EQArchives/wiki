**Haste is a game mechanic by which the delay of a weapon is decreased.**

## Brief Overview

Haste is an extremely important game mechanic for all melee classes in Everquest. There are various types of haste, and it is important to understand how they all work together to maximize your DPS (damage per second).

Gear Haste is only one type of haste and may not be affordable at the beginning of your melee / DPS adventure through everquest but you should strive to obtain these pieces as you progress through the game.

Haste reduces the delay of a weapon and as a result will affect the dps rating of certain weapons differently depending on delay and amount of haste stacked. Delay is measured in tenths of a second. IE a weapon with a delay of 20 would swing every 2 seconds.

**Important Note:** Haste reduces the delay of all weapons the same percentage, however the increase in dps output varies depending on the starting delay of the equipped weapon. (I'll dig up a few dps charts later to help people visualize the difference but the increase in dps output is essentially an exponential curve upward as haste increases.)

Basically there are accelerating gains in dps as more haste is stacked on, but higher delay weapons dps output accelerates faster than lower delay weapons dps output. Acceleration of dps output is not the same as dps output, so to make a determination of which weapon is best for a given situation you would have to take into account a variety of factors including the amount of haste you have, your atk rating, and the defense rating of what you are fighting.

A comprehensive listing of all known haste items, spells, and songs is listed below.

## General Rules

### The three types of haste
1. **Permanent item haste:** haste effect listed on an item you wear.
2. **Spell/song/clickie haste:** haste effects gained from nearly all spells, bard songs, or click-able items.
3. **v2 haste:** Ervaj line of bard songs grant v2 haste. This is not "overhaste" and will not allow you to exceed the haste cap.
4. **Overhaste (v3 haste):** These effects allow you to exceed the haste cap, but no such effects existed before the "Shadows of Luclin" expansion was released.

### Rules
- Haste effects of the same type will not stack, whereas haste effects of differing type will usually stack.
- Haste is measured in Rate of Attack Increase, NOT Delay Decrease.
- The FORMULA for determining Delay with Haste is:
  - **New (Hasted) Delay = Delay/(1+Haste)**, where Haste is a decimal (21% == .21). FBSS Example: [Delay/(1+.21)]
- The minimum weapon delay is 5 (need confirmation, see Mosscovered Twig discussions).
- Delay is rounded up. IE a 'New (Hasted) Delay' of 17.02 would result in a delay of 18

### Important notes

- Celestial Tranquility (monk epic) grants "spell/song/clickie haste" and therefore will stack with "permanent item haste" effects, but will not stack with other "spell/song/clickie haste" effects.
- The Monk Discipline 100 Fists (lvl 57) grants "Hundred Hands Effect" that will stack with all types of haste effects.
- Melody/Composition of Ervaj grant v2 haste, and therefore stack with other types of haste. These songs do not allow you to exceed the haste cap.

### Haste Caps

| Level | Max total haste permitted |
|-------|---------------------------|
| 1-30  | 50% |
| 31-50 | 74% |
| 51-54 | 84% |
| 55-59 | 94% |
| 60    | 100% |

## 99% VoG vs 100% Haste

There's a large debate about whether the 99% haste + 20 attack from VoG (while wearing 41% haste) is better or about the same as 100% haste with SoS. Below is a table of some datasets parsed to see if there is a significant DPS variance. If you provide data for this, make sure to rule out any extra variance via different gear, buffs, atk, etc. Ideally, people would test against different targets of varying AC and levels to try to figure out the best haste buff for each type of mob.

| Level | Class | Weapon(s) | ATK | Haste | Mob | Total DMG | Time | DPS |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----|-------|-----|-----------|------|-----|
| 60 | Monk | Imbued Fighters Staff | 1206 | 41% + VoG | Bloodmaw | 42,241 | 378s | 111 |
