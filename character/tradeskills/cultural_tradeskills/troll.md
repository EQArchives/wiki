>Note: It seems that Troll cultural smithing was added post-Luclin (May 8, 2002 tradeskill patch).{.is-info}

However, given that most other smithing recipes/trivials are currently post-may8-patch, Troll cultural smithing may exist (see [EQTraders Recipes](http://web.archive.org/web/20020603074635/http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing_troll.htm)).

Trolls can wear [Ogre Cultural Armor](/character/tradeskills/cultural_tradeskills/ogre), if they worship the correct deity (Cazic Thule or Rallos Zek).
