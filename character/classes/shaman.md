Shamans are a strange class. One of the most versatile classes in EverQuest, they can do a bit of everything, from melee to all manner of casting. Shamans are not as equipped as some other classes at striking their enemies directly, but they are far more effective in wearing them down with disease, poison and other debilitating effects. Shamans are also more effective than Druids at buffing themselves and others through quickness/alacrity, ability buffs and utility enhancements. They can also melee better than any other priest class.

Spells are the stock-in-trade of a Shaman. Without them, the Shaman is little more than meat for any monster. Acquire spells as soon as you can, and as often as you can, no matter how inconvenient it may seem. The "save money, buy spell, save money" cycle may seem repetitive, but when your spellbook is full and monsters topple before you, you will realize the value of this strategy.

The most important spells to a Shaman are those that focus on defense. Spells that heal or buff stats and attributes are the Shaman's fort√©. Keep a good number of buffing spells memorized, especially in a party. They can make a big difference when cast on an already tough Warrior. Do not, however, neglect the healing spells, which should also be a priority for you in group-based combat. Shamans are most widely sought for their healing, and secondly for their modifying spells. Concentrate on both, but remember that the best-healing Shaman is the most useful.

In addition to defense, Shamans receive a few offensive spells. These spells are nice supplements to group combat, but are most often cast in small parties or while soloing a monster. In a large party, the offensive spells are mostly a waste of mana. Leave the major spell damage to the pure casting classes. They can deal much more damage, and your skills are better concentrated on preparation and healing, where you excel.

Armor and weapons are tempting prospects, but they are usually only secondary tools. Spells are the strength of a wise Shaman, and they should be used with great care. Focus largely upon your spells, and you will be able to overcome most obstacles that stand in your way.

# Creation Guide

It is important to make good decisions on Race, Starting Stats, and Religion. These things combined will allow you to create the Shaman that makes you most happy.

## Choosing Race

### Barbarian

Barbarians make great Shamans, due to the fact that they are liked among the majority of races throughout Norrath. This allows them to travel freely once they reach a certain level. They have well-balanced stats, and a decent amount of wisdom. They can also wear medium and large sized armor. Barbarians will level faster than any other Shaman race.

### Ogre

Ogres are the middlemen of the Shaman class. They have the second lowest Wisdom, and are hated in most cities. They do have the ability to see in the dark, as well as having by far the highest Strength and Stamina among Shamans. This gives them a greater weight allowance and maximum hit points. Additionally, Ogres have an innate immunity to stunning blows from the front.

### Troll

Trolls do make good Shamans, but they are held back by a couple of factors. They have the lowest Wisdom of all the races that can be a Shaman, and they are hated by many throughout Norrath. The upside is they have the ability to see in the dark very well, as well as enhanced regeneration--twice the speed of standard regeneration. Trolls will also level more slowly than Ogres.

### Iksar

Iksar (Kunark expansion) share the same regenerative abilities as trolls, can forage, have an innate AC bonus, but they cannot wear plate armor - including Planar and Kunark sets. Things even out in Velious, but think carefully before choosing an Iksar. Iksar are hated in almost every city, good or evil.

## Starting Statistics

The primary two stats for Shaman are Stamina and Wisdom, and Shaman are highly encouraged to spend their bonus points on these two stats. Reasonable Shaman can disagree about the exact benefit of one vs. the other (and of HP vs. Mana in general).

The remaining stats have marginal benefit to Shaman. Greater Strength allows carrying more weight, greater Charisma saves money on merchant transactions, and Dexterity increases the rate of weapon "procs" (such as the Worker Sledgemallet).

Intelligence is completely worthless to Shaman, and Agility only offers very minor AC increases ... above 75. However, below 75 Agility adds much more significantly to AC, so Ogre Shaman should very likely put at least five bonus points into this stat.

The following table lists the starting stats of each Shaman race. All races get 30 additional stat points at character creation.

| Race | STR | DEX | AGI | STA | INT | WIS | CHA | Bonus |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Barbarian | 103 | 70 | 82 | 100 | 60 | 80 | 60 | 30 |
| Iksar | 70 | 85 | 90 | 75 | 75 | 90 | 60 | 30 |
| Ogre | 130 | 70 | 70 | 127 | 60 | 77 | 42 | 30 |
| Troll | 108 | 75 | 83 | 114 | 52 | 70 | 45 | 30 |

## Regeneration

| Level Range | Barbarian/Ogre | | | Iksar/Troll | | |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|             | Standing | Feigned | Sitting | Standing | Feigned | Sitting |
| 1-19 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 4 |
| 20-49 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 6 |
| 50 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 8 |
| 51-55 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 6 | 8 | 12 |
| 56-59 | 3 | 4 | 6 | 10 | 12 | 16 |
| 60 | 4 | 5 | 7 | 12 | 14 | 18 |

## Religion

Barbarians must follow The Tribunal, Ogres follow Rallos Zek, and Trolls get a choice between Innoruuk and Cazic-Thule. Trolls who choose to follow Innoruuk will be able to quest for the Regent Symbol of Innoruuk which gives them a low level snare effect.

# Skills

## Specialization

Shamans have two real choices: Alteration and Conjuration.

**Conjuration** is mainly useful for shamans who solo or kite a lot. This is a good Specialization to take if you plan on soloing up until around level 35, or plan on using DoTs a lot.

**Alteration** is used for almost all of a shaman's buffs, heals, regenerations, hastes, slows, roots, and the like. These are cast far more often in groups, and you can save a great deal of mana with this as your Specialization.

Alteration is a pretty safe bet, but if you attack more, and enhance less, then Conjuration is still worth considering.

# Item-Based

## Reclaim Energy

Although the spell Reclaim Energy is not technically on the Shaman spell list, it is very useful for Shaman, as it allows them to despawn their pet to get back the mana they spent on casting it. This allows much faster "pet cycling" (ie. repeatedly summoning a pet until you get one of maximum level) and lets them use their pet as a backup mana battery in emergencies when mana runs out.

Fortunately Shaman can effectively gain this spell by completing one of the four Magician Focus Items quests given by Vira in The Temple of Solusek Ro. Although Shaman can't equip the focus item, they can still right-click it from inventory, allowing them to use Reclaim Energy (mana-free) as if it was a part of their spell list.
