The Paladin of Norrath are champions of their patron deity, and heroes of all that is good and just; the very image of a knight (by which name they are often called). A Paladin's duty is to fight the forces of darkness at all costs, and to assist those who are too weak to defend themselves. The good people of Norrath will always welcome a Paladin to their homes and stores, often giving the knight a cheaper price on their wares than is offered to adventurers of other classes. Many are the Paladin's enemies, however. Foul perversions of darkness will stop at nothing to see him ripped limb from limb. Only if a Paladin places his trust in his god, his sword and his friends can he overcome.

Paladins are part Warrior, part Cleric. They possess skills of both, but are masters of neither. Most people consider a Paladin more Warrior than Cleric, and for good reason. A knight can take blows from a monster and fight back with his sword from level 1. All but one of his spells, however, are gained only after he reaches the level 9.

The only spell a Paladin can use before level 9 is a special ability, unique to the Paladin class. They can Lay on Hands, which will almost completely heal a person of similar level to the Paladin. This can only be used once a day, but saves the life of many a friend or stranger who would otherwise surely die. Lay on Hands is used throughout the life of a Paladin, even at level 60! Rest assured that this is a worthy ability.

When a Paladin does get the use of his first spells, which are also healing in nature, he can become an even more valuable asset to a group by helping to ease the strain on the group healer during downtime. It is rare, however, that a Paladin stops fighting mid-battle to use his spells, because they are much weaker in power than a healer's of the same level. In fact, many are discouraged from being a Paladin because they consider the spells a Paladin can cast too inferior to be of any use. Making full use of a Paladin's limited magical repertoire is simply a matter of knowing when to do what. For example, using the paltry Minor Healing several times to heal a caster who has attracted the attention of a monster can save an entire party at a crucial juncture.

One of the easier classes to play, the Paladin's life is simple and straightforward at the lower levels. She taunts the monsters off of the weaker classes in a group, while attempting to damage the monsters with her weapon.

The life of a Paladin may sound glamorous, but keep in mind a few things. Once spells are learned, the Paladin sometimes needs to sit and rest to regain his mana. After level 12, a Paladin can learn to Meditate. Although this regains his mana faster, he must sit and stare at his spellbook. This means he cannot be used to pull monsters while meditating. A Paladin gets all of his spells from the Cleric class, but does not get all of the Cleric spells. The only offensive spells a Paladin can use for most of his life are only effective against undead. A Paladin can never summon food and water. Being mainly a melee class, he will never be able to Bind himself; a Paladin is limited to getting a bind in select zones (usually city zones). Healing and buffing spells are in a Paladin's spell-book, but anything he can use is vastly inferior to a Cleric's spells at the same level. For example, the spells a Paladin can buy at level 9 are all level 1 and 4 Cleric spells. This is a drawback, indeed.

If your ideal class is primarily a healer, then do not be a Paladin. If you are overly concerned with leveling up quickly, then do not be a Paladin. If you have ever wanted to be a knight in shining armor, quest diligently for powerful weapons, be a hero to the people, or fight against all that is evil, march forward proudly as a Paladin.

# Creation Guide

It is important to make good decisions on Race, Starting Stats, and Religion. These things combined will allow you to create the Paladin that makes you most happy.

## Choosing Race

Choosing a race for any class can be a difficult decision--do not choose a race based on abilities alone. Choose the Race that provides you with the right mix of racial benefits, religion, cultural armor sets, and statistics that benefit your class. Here are some considerations for your Paladin:

| Race | Benefit | Detractor |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Dwarf** | High STR/DEX, Barrel rolls! Small size is handy in dungeons, night vision | Low AGI |
| **Erudite** | - | Poor night vision, low primary stats |
| **Gnome*** | Small size is handy in dungeons, night vision, awesome plate graphics | Low STR / STA |
| **Half-Elf** | Good AGI / DEX | Low WIS |
| **Halfling*** | Small size is handy in dungeons, hide/sneak, faster leveling | You look like a halfling |
| **High Elf** | Night vision | Low STR / STA |
| **Human** | - | Poor night vision, lower starting stats |

*The * denotes races that were not originally allowed to be paladins. While this is permitted on FV server, on Live these combinations were not possible until the March 19, 2002 patch (4 months after the December 2001 Shadows of Luclin launch)*

## Starting Statistics

It is important to note that each race has slightly different starting statistics. For Paladins, your WIS is important for a larger mana pool, and AGI contributes to your AC. You will likely find that it is easiest to max WIS if you pursue raiding and high-end gear.

| Race | STR | DEX | AGI | STA | INT | WIS | CHA | Bonus |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Dwarf | 100 | 90 | 70 | 95 | 60 | 88 | 55 | 20 |
| Erudite | 70 | 70 | 70 | 75 | 107 | 88 | 80 | 20 |
| Gnome* | 70 | 85 | 85 | 75 | 98 | 72 | 70 | 20 |
| Half-Elf | 80 | 85 | 90 | 75 | 75 | 65 | 85 | 20 |
| Halfling* | 80 | 90 | 95 | 80 | 67 | 85 | 60 | 20 |
| High Elf | 65 | 70 | 85 | 70 | 92 | 100 | 90 | 20 |
| Human | 85 | 75 | 75 | 80 | 75 | 80 | 85 | 20 |

Each race gets 20 bonus points to apply to the base stats of their choosing.

## Spending Your Bonus Points

Paladins are a tanking support class with great defensive skills and a powerful spells set to help you keep your group alive. As a paladin you are expected to have a high amount of hit points and AC to perform your main role as a tank and a decent mana pool to cast your aggro spells (flash of light and stun). With that in mind the most agreed upon is your agility should be 75 (erudites and dwarves must increase this), and you should dump as much as you can after that into stamina. After those two, weigh your options:

- **Wisdom:** Will increase your manapool
- **Strength:** Will increase your damage output (albeit slightly)
- **Dexterity:** Will increase the likelihood of procs (Ghoulbane, Fiery Avenger, and Fiery Defender come to mind)
- **Charisma:** Will increase the success rate of the Lull line of spells

Realistic/Modern statistic allocation:

- **Dwarf:** Add 15 to Stamina and 5 to Agility.
- **Erudite:** Add 15 to Stamina and 5 to Agility.
- **Half Elf:** Add 20 to Stamina.
- **High Elf:** Add 20 to Stamina.
- **Human:** Add 20 to Stamina.

## Religion

Paladins must choose a religion, as their magic powers flow from their devotion to their chosen god. There will be some gear that is deity-specific (i.e. Natures Defender in the Velious expansion). Your religion will also impact on where your character can start. Selections include Karana, Rodcet Nife, Erollisi Marr, Brell Serilis, Mithaniel Marr, Prexus, Tunare, and Quellious. Depending on your race you will be given a different number of these deities to choose from.

## Miscellaneous Skills

Like all classes, Paladins can raise the following skills:

## Disciplines

Disciplines first appeared in the Ruins of Kunark expansion for pure melee classes. However, Paladin disciplines weren't introduced until the Scars of Velious expansion; they offer short term advantages with a long re-use: These are most useful in dragon/boss encounters.

| Discipline Name | Level Obtained | Description | Duration | Reuse Time | Expansion |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| Resistant Discipline | 51 | +10 to all resistances. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as you level. | 5 Min | 60 Min | Scars of Velious |
| Fearless Discipline | 54 | Immunity to "Fear" and all spells that cause "fear". The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as you level. | 11 Sec | 60 Min | Scars of Velious |
| Holyforge Discipline | 55 | Critical Hits versus everything and Crippling Blows versus undead with an increased probability of going off. | 5 Min | 72 Min | Scars of Velious |
| Sanctification Discipline | 60 | 100% Spell resistance. You will resist all spells that are not unresistable. | 18 Sec | 72 Min | Scars of Velious |

# Hybrid Casting

*The following patch message was included in the February 21, 2001 patch on EQ Live just over two months after the launch of The Scars of Velious. It will not apply to FV server until the project reaches Velious:*

Hybrids that cast spells in combat were taking double penalties at higher levels. The casting times of their spells went up, and the amount of melee damage they do per second went up. This results is having to take longer to cast spells, and losing more damage/second for each second taken in casting. To help offset this, Rangers, Paladins and Shadowknights casting non-beneficial spells that have casting times greater than or equal to 3 seconds, now get a 3 % reduction in casting time for each level over 50. 3% at 51, 6% at 52, etc., to 30% at 60. Again, this applies only to non-beneficial spells.
