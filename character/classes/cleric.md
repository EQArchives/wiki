The Cleric is the foundation for almost every great group found in the vast lands of Norrath. Clerics are the masters of healing and resurrection, uncontested by any class of the same level. From the day a young Cleric is born he is gifted by his god with the power to heal himself and more importantly, to heal others. But healing is only the beginning; the Cleric is also the wielder of the most powerful hit point and armor class buffs in the game, and has a wide array of other spells to support himself and his party. This makes Clerics a welcome addition to any group, and extremely popular in every zone. This class is best suited for players who enjoy helping others, are friendly and don't mind getting a lot of /tells asking for help or invites to groups. Kind and selfless Clerics do not have to look far to find a friend ... and having the support of many friends is an excellent way to survive. This support often saves the Cleric's life, as Clerics are among the most hated classes by hostile entities at large. Fortunately, Clerics can don a full suit of plate armor, when they are able to find it in an appropriate size. Even well crafted steel plate is often not enough, and to add an additional defense the Cleric gets the most powerful shield spell of any class in the game.

In dire situations, even the rawest young Cleric has the ability to make himself invincible (Divine Aura). Neither blade nor spell can damage a fleeing Cleric while under this spell's protection. Of course, such a powerful shield has its downside; it lasts but a few seconds and takes fifteen minutes to recycle, during which time the Cleric cannot cast or attack. The divine line of spells tends to save an endangered Cleric more often then any other.

Healing, buffing and resurrection are by no means all that a Cleric can offer a group. Also within their power is the ability to cure many infections, and protect characters from disease before it strikes. They can stop a creature in its tracks and make it forget that it was mad at all, or more importantly, whom it was mad at. And they are one of the few classes that can cause a monster to run in fear for its life. They can stun attackers who attempt to cast spells or slice the Cleric or his friends to shreds. Several different sorts of direct damage (DD) spells are available to the Cleric as well. There are also the abilities to dispel magic, summon food and water, and various other spells.

New Clerics should accept that their role in the adventuring life is, more often than not, that of a support character. Mixing it up in melee is typical at the earliest levels, though all but abandoned soon after. The weapons Clerics seek are usually selected for their added protection, or to make the Cleric a better healer through increased Wisdom.

Of all the spells available in Norrath the Cleric has the single most sought-after spell: Resurrection. Experienced Clerics have it within their power to summon a character back to her fallen corpse. It does not matter how near or far from the corpse the fallen character has re- spawned. A Cleric of sufficient experience can teleport the character from any location on the globe to her body. When the Cleric masters this spell, it also rewards the recently deceased with a large portion of the experience points lost at death. This makes the Cleric one of the most rewarding classes to play, and perfect for players who want to be a noble, beloved hero.

# Creation Guide

It is important to make good decisions on Race, Starting Stats, and Religion. These things combined will allow you to create the Cleric that makes you most happy.

## Choosing Race

Choosing a race for any class can be a difficult decision--do not choose a race based on abilities alone. Choose the Race that provides you with the right mix of racial benefits, religion, cultural armor sets, and statistics that benefit your class. Here are some considerations for your Cleric:

| Race | Benefit | Detractor |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Dark Elf** | Master race, hide/sneak, night vision | So-called "good" vendors may not trade at lower levels |
| **Dwarf** | Barrel rolls! Small size is handy in dungeons, night vision | - |
| **Erudite** | - | Poor night vision |
| **Gnome** | Small size is handy in dungeons, night vision, awesome plate graphics | lower starting stats |
| **Human** | - | Poor night vision, lower starting stats |
| **Halfling** | Small size is handy in dungeons, hide/sneak, faster leveling | You look like a halfling |
| **High Elf** | Night vision, good starting stats | You look like everyone else's cleric |

Just because High Elves get more starting WIS does not mean you should only pick High Elves for your cleric. Consider the fact that Clerics do not get an invis spell and that only Dark Elves and Halflings are able to innately hide/sneak.

## Starting Statistics

It is important to note that each race has slightly different starting statistics. For Clerics, your WIS is important for a larger mana pool, and AGI contributes to your AC. You will likely find that it is easiest to max WIS if you pursue raiding and high-end gear.

| Race | STR | STA | AGI | DEX | WIS | INT | CHA | Total |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Dark Elf | 65 | 70 | 90 | 75 | 93 | 99 | 60 | 552 |
| Dwarf | 95 | 95 | 70 | 90 | 93 | 60 | 45 | 548 |
| Erudite | 65 | 75 | 70 | 70 | 93 | 107 | 70 | 550 |
| Gnome | 65 | 75 | 85 | 85 | 77 | 98 | 60 | 545 |
| Halfling | 75 | 80 | 95 | 90 | 90 | 67 | 50 | 547 |
| High Elf | 60 | 70 | 85 | 70 | 105 | 92 | 80 | 562 |
| Human | 80 | 80 | 75 | 75 | 85 | 75 | 75 | 547 |

Each race gets 30 bonus points to apply to the base stats of their choosing.

## Religion

Clerics cannot be agnostic and are forced to choose a religion. The worship of evil gods can lead to some problems in some zones, but these can easily be avoided. Choose a god which you think will tie in well with the nature of your character.

You may consider looking at the deity-specific quests, however, before picking a deity. If you're willing to worship an evil god you can get one of the few snare items available to Clerics in game.

# Skills

## Specialization

Clerics have two primary choices of Specialization: Alteration and Evocation.

**Alteration** is by far the most popular choice. It covers heals, cures, roots, and resurrection spells. This means you'll be able to heal more damage for every point of your mana, the most important consideration for any cleric outside of soloing. It can also reduce the cost of mana-intensive resurrection spells.

**Evocation** is a choice that many clerics attempting to solo decide to choose. All the cleric direct damage spells are Evocation, and apart from the Ward Undead and Ward Summoned line are inherently inefficient. The cleric's stun line is also evocation-based, providing some utility for a cleric in a group, as every point of damage a stunned mob doesn't do, is one that doesn't need to be healed.
