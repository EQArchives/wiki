The mighty Magician, or mage as they have come to be known, is a powerful force in Norrath. These masters of summoning are never truly alone, for they can call forth the power of an elemental to fight and defend them, and in some cases fend off foes as the mage makes a hasty escape to safety.

There are four different types of pets at the mage's disposal, one for each element: Fire, Earth, Air and Water. Each pet has specific uses, and it takes some time to fully understand their natures. It is a challenge for a young mage to learn the proper use of pets in varying situations.

With the wiggle of a finger, the Magician can also conjure an array of powerful weapons for her pet, party members or herself. Each of these weapons has the inherent ability to hit magic creatures. Along with this arsenal of weapons comes a long list of useful items, including food, water, bandages, arrows, weight-reducing bags, water-breathing stones, levitation rings and various light sources (that fit in the ammo slot). Of course the ability to summon these items and the amount summoned (for stackable items) is determined by the mage's level. The drawback of all the Magician's summoned items is that they are no rent — they will disappear when you log out. Particular care must be exercised when using a weight-reducing bag, as it (along with its contents) will vanish when the user of the item camps for the evening.

The Magician also gets the best personal shields of any pure caster. The phantom armor line of spells not only increases the Magician's armor class, but also adds hit point regeneration. They can be stacked with other hit-point-increasing buffs and help the Magician survive just a little longer in fierce combat. The drawback to the phantom armor spells is that they require a component that can be expensive at lower levels.

When it comes to pure damage, the Magician is, throughout most of her career, second only to the Wizard for Direct Damage output. As easily as the mage summons elementals and items, she can blast a foe with the power of a hundred slashing swords or daggers all at once, for devastating damage. It is also common to see a powerful fireball emanate from a mage to incenerate her enemies. Being the master of summoned beings, the mage is also an expert in dispatching them. Summoned foes will find it hard to resist this line of spells. The Magician also gets a line of area-effect spells (the rain line) that can be cast from a distance for increased safety. Area effect spells are dangerous by nature, and this line of area- effect spells is the best in the game.

Magicians also get fire shields that cannot be resisted, and are extremely mana-efficient when cast properly. This is especially true when cast just before a battle against several foes at once. Even if the monster is many levels higher than the mage and resists every spell, the fire shield line of spells will always do damage each time the character wearing one is hit. However, they last just a short time, so timing of the spell is a critical factor.

Finally, the Magician gets the malise line of debuffing spells. These spells lower the target's resistances and give the spells that follow a better chance at doing damage and reaching their maximum potential.

With all this power at hand, it may seem that the Magician is an easy class to play. However, the opposite is true. True mastery of the mage class only comes from many months of playtime, many deaths on the battlefield and much research. The Magician is often vulnerable to attack and cannot last very long in melee combat, even with her shields up. Mages also typically have low Strength and can become encumbered quite easily, but proper use of weight-reducing bags can help alleviate this problem. The Magician also faces the most difficult research of all the caster classes — the time needed to master each spell is lengthy, and the process arduous. Most of the high-level pet spells cannot be purchased from vendors.

While it is true Magicians are one of the best classes to solo (thanks to the combat support of their pets), they also excel in groups. The rest of a group will find the Magician's pets both welcome and helpful. Group members will not have to worry about running out of food, water or bandages when a mage is in their party. They can also count on their mage friend to reduce their enemies from half hit points to death in a single cast, on many occasions.

# Creation Guide

It is important to make good decisions on Race, Starting Stats, and Religion. These things combined will allow you to create the Wizard that makes you most happy.

## Choosing Race

**Dark Elf**

Dark Elf mages have the disadvantage of being evil, so they are not welcome in many cities. They also start in Neriak, an underground city that can be difficult to navigate. They have higher starting Agility than other mages, and the second highest Intelligence, plus ultravision. Dark Elf mages are a great combination for players who like a challenge.

**Erudite**

Erudite mages have the highest starting Intelligence of all the Magician races. This gives them the largest mana pool to begin with. They are tied with the High Elf for the lowest Dexterity, and have the worst Agility of all the mage races. Note that they have poor night vision, and that they must take a boat to the mainlands for more advanced hunting.

**Gnome**

Gnome mages have an excellent starting Intelligence, and closely follow Dark Elf mages in the size of their beginning mana pool. They have the highest Dexterity of all the mage races, as well as very good Agility. They can see in the dark, and can eventually learn Tinkering. They are an excellent choice for mages who like to be unique.

**High Elf**

The High Elf mage has the lowest Strength of all the races, but makes up for it with well balanced stats otherwise, including an Intelligence comparable to the Gnome and Dark Elf. In addition, they can see in the dark and there's an excellent training ground available to the citizens of Felwithe.

**Human**

The Human mage has well-rounded stats, but suffers from the lowest Intelligence of all the races. Human Magicians have the highest Strength and Stamina of all the mage races. They have no night vision, but get to start in what is considered by many to be the business capital of Norrath.

## Starting Statistics

| Race | STR | DEX | AGI | STA | INT | WIS | CHA | Bonus |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Dark Elf | 60 | 75 | 90 | 75 | 109 | 83 | 60 | 30 |
| Erudite | 60 | 70 | 70 | 80 | 117 | 83 | 70 | 30 |
| Gnome | 60 | 85 | 85 | 80 | 108 | 67 | 60 | 30 |
| High Elf | 55 | 70 | 85 | 75 | 102 | 95 | 80 | 30 |
| Human | 75 | 75 | 75 | 85 | 85 | 75 | 75 | 30 |

## Religion

Generally speaking being agnostic is a fairly safe bet in Everquest. Religion serves only to get you into trouble in many situations. The disadvantage to doing this is that some items and some quests can only be done by followers of certain religions. Following a religion will at worst get you killed in some areas, but generally you can avoid these. Following Innoruuk is probably the most dangerous religion as they have the most places in the game where they are Kill on Sight. In the end it will not make an enormous difference to your character which Deity you choose.

# Skills

See also Languages for a skill listing of available Languages.

## Specialization

There are two main choices when selecting a specialization as a Magician: Evocation (AoE and a few DD spells) or Conjuration. Evocation is mostly direct damage. Conjuration is summoning, from pets to food to weapons, although there are some DD conjurations. When given the opportunity to specialize, Magicians who want the casting- time and mana-cost reductions to affect the greatest number of their spells choose Conjuration, while many opt for Evocation to bolster their combat casting effectiveness.

Your decision is just a matter of preference, but many Magicians choose Evocation because that's used during battle. You'll be casting Conjuration spells a lot (in fact, most of the Magician spells are in Conjuration), but the casting is during non-critical times ... so you can just med back up. (Note that the shock line of spells, a Magicians' best DD spells, are Conjuration-based.)
