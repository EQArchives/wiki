Only the blackest pits of hell can spew forth the soul that will become a Shadow Knight. Before birth, this soul is molded in the direct image of the evil god that is to be his master. This fact is known early in the child's life, and the soul's dark aura draws the priests from the temples in search of their evil god's new servant. From birth Shadow Knights are taught to hate all things pure, and the destruction of all that is good and holy is their foul mission.

At a young age, fueled by the hatred and bitterness imbued by their god, they are brought into training to become a dark knight. Day after day they train, becoming proficient not only in the arts of killing, but in magnifying the inflicted pain, reveling in watching their opponents suffer as they die. This is the fire that drives them from the temples that have become their homes and out to slaughter indiscriminately until they feel that their destiny has been fulfilled.

Shadow Knights begin their unholy crusade with only the skills they learn in the temples and their natural fighting abilities. The first few months are a test to see whether or not the creature will fare well in the overworld. Upon attaining their ninth rank, the gods themselves touch their Shadow Knights, giving them direct control over the dark magics. Fear, pain and mastery of the undead are among the many gifts bestowed upon those paragons of evil who survive their initial tests. These, coupled with the devastating ability known more commonly as Harm Touch, make the newly reborn Shadow Knight an entity to fear and avoid.

Because of the evil aura that emanates from these dark knights, most inhabitants of Norrath react to them in a fearful, almost terrified manner. Even in their own cities, they are shunned, spoken about only in whispers and avoided at all costs. Like rats, Human Shadow Knights live beneath the cities in the sewers and tunnels. Even in the cities of the evil races — the homes of Trolls, Ogres and the mysterious Dark Elves — they are shunned and distrusted.

In battle, the Shadow Knight is a fanatic; charging into the fight to stand toe to toe with the enemy, ably assisted by a skeletal minion. Though fanatics, these knights are wise fighters and will back off to fight another day if the tide of battle turns against them. If they are terribly outnumbered, a well placed Harm Touch or a fear spell may even the odds a bit or at least give them time to flee.

## Creation Guide

It is important to make good decisions on Race, Starting Stats, and Religion. These things combined will allow you to create the Shadowknight that makes you most happy.

### Choosing Race

Choosing a race for any class can be a difficult decision--do not choose a race based on abilities alone. Choose the Race that provides you with the right mix of racial benefits, religion, cultural armor sets, and statistics that benefit your class. Here are some considerations for your Shadowknight:

**Dark Elf**

Dark Elves make great Shadowknights. They have a decent Strength and a high Intelligence. These Elves can wear small to medium armor and have ultravision. While they are not the most frightening of the races, in full black plate with a skeletal minion by their side they are an awesome sight. Dark Elves are hated throughout Norrath, but so are the Shadow Knights of any other race. The biggest drawback Dark Elf Shadow Knights face is at higher levels, where it takes most of their Strength just to wear the extremely heavy Shadow Knight armor.

**Erudite**

Erudite Shadowknights are outcasts from Erudin and generally hated throughout the lands. They are the most intelligent of all the Shadow Knights, yet lack the infravision that the other races have. Erudite Shadow Knights can expect a hard life, particularly at lower levels where their unimpressive physical stats limit their development as fighters, and they face the hatred of almost all the creatures in their own starting lands.

**Gnome**

The addition of Gnomes as Shadowknights offers a unique opportunity to try something different during an era that did not offer this race/class combination. Don't let their small stature fool you--Gnomes can make formidable Shadowknights.

**Human**

Probably the most downtrodden of all the Shadow Knights, Human Shadow Knights are invariably banned from the cities and forced to live in underground sewer systems and tunnels. Even though they worship the same gods, and practice the same arts, they are also never allowed in the cities of the Dark Elves, Trolls or Ogres, unless they work long and hard to prove their sincere devotion to the dark arts. Humans lack infravision, regeneration or other unique abilities. They do have good all- around stats, and it's somewhat easier for them to overcome hatred of their class than it is for their Erudite brethren.

**Iksar**

This race becomes playable after the launch of the Ruins of Kunark expansion. Iksars can only trade in Cabilis, and and are otherwise unwelcome in all other cities in Norrath except Thurgadin. They will level the slowest (along with Trolls) with a 20% racial experience penalty. On servers where the hybrid class experience penalty is still in place, which includes Original and Kunark servers, it will take an Iksar or Troll Shadowknight more than twice the experience to reach Level 60 as compared to a Halfling warrior. *They cannot wear Plate armor* until the Scars of Velious expansion. They do, however get to Forage, have increased armor class (+15AC), increased hp regeneration, infravision, swimming starting at 100, +5 Fire Resist, and -10 Cold Resist.

**Ogre**

Their immense size and Strength give them an ominous presence, and their Strength is a bonus in many other ways. Not only will the Ogre be able to carry more equipment, she will also hit much harder in later levels. Their biggest drawback is their low Intelligence, but this is more than made up for by their massive physical abilities. The Ogre Shadow Knight is a truly fearsome creature.

**Troll**

An extremely fun combination to play, the Troll Shadow Knight is strong and hardy, and comes fully equipped with infravision and enhanced regeneration. The large stature of this race can be somewhat cumbersome, but the image of a massive creature in solid black followed by an undead minion is one that will leave your opponents with nightmares. Their biggest downside is their low Intelligence and slow accumulation of experience, the worst of all the races.

### Starting Statistics

It is important to note that each race has slightly different starting statistics. For Clerics, your WIS is important for a larger mana pool, and AGI contributes to your AC. You will likely find that it is easiest to max WIS if you pursue raiding and high-end gear.

| Race | STR | DEX | AGI | STA | INT | WIS | CHA | Bonus |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Dark Elf | 70 | 75 | 90 | 70 | 109 | 83 | 65 | 20 |
| Erudite | 70 | 70 | 70 | 75 | 117 | 83 | 75 | 20 |
| Gnome | 70 | 85 | 85 | 75 | 108 | 67 | 65 | 20 |
| Human | 85 | 75 | 75 | 80 | 85 | 75 | 80 | 20 |
| Iksar | 80 | 85 | 90 | 75 | 85 | 80 | 60 | 20 |
| Ogre | 140 | 70 | 70 | 127 | 70 | 67 | 42 | 20 |
| Troll | 118 | 75 | 83 | 114 | 62 | 60 | 45 | 20 |

Each race gets 20 bonus points to apply to the base stats of their choosing.

### Religion

Religion is not of a huge concern to Shadow Knights as they are already hated. Most choose to worship Innoruuk the Prince of Hate, as it ties in well their role. The other choices are Cazic-Thule, Bertoxxulous, or Rallos Zek. Shadow Knights cannot be agnostic, as their dark powers are directly linked to their study or worship of their deity and the dead.

| Leechcurse Discipline | 60 | Heal self for every point of melee damage dealt while discipline is active. | 15 Seconds | 72 Min | The Scars of Velious | Increases hit probability in addition to its other effects. |

## Hybrid Casting

*The following patch message was included in the February 21, 2001 patch on EQ Live just over two months after the launch of The Scars of Velious.

> Hybrids that cast spells in combat were taking double penalties at higher levels. The casting times of their spells went up, and the amount of melee damage they do per second went up. This results is having to take longer to cast spells, and losing more damage/second for each second taken in casting. To help offset this, Rangers, Paladins and Shadowknights casting non-beneficial spells that have casting times greater than or equal to 3 seconds, now get a 3 % reduction in casting time for each level over 50. 3% at 51, 6% at 52, etc., to 30% at 60. Again, this applies only to non-beneficial spells.
