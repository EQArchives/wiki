  **Beastlord** is a unique class which combines some powers from the [Monk](/character/classes/monk) and [Shaman](/character/classes/shaman) classes along with a powerful pet. Beastlords can imbue their pets with powers and combat enemies with hand-to-hand skills or with weapons. They can "de-buff" enemies with spells, and possess modest healing abilities. This diverse array of skills allows Beastlords to be effective solo adventurers at many levels as well as being handy in a group. Six races can be beastlords, Barbarians, Iksars, Ogres, Trolls, Vah Shir, and Wood Elves. 

## In-Game Description
Beastlords are the masters of raw nature, who focus this energy into themselves and their warder pets. Beastlords are primarily a melee class, with the ability to wear leather armor and wield blunt weapons, or use their bare hands to attack.

Beastlords prepare for battle by calling on their animal warder and increasing the creature's natural abilities with spells. Beastlords share ever battle with their warders, fighting along side these fierce companions or falling back to heal and aid.

Beastlords also gain spells to slow or damage their opponents. Beastlords can heal and add an ally's health and mana regeneration as well, making them a well-rounded ally in battle.

Beastlords can adventure solo well in many places. They depend upon coordination with their warders and well planned spells to finish every fight, but they can also aid a group through their spells and melee abilities. The beastlord is a great class for players who like the option of solo melee fights, but want to be able to help in a group.
