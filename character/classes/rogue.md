You can look at the name "Rogue" one of two ways: Rogue means "scoundrel" — someone who cannot be trusted — but it also means someone (or something) different, unhindered by the rules that govern others. They're not quite the same thing, but they're close. Exactly how you play a Rogue is up to you.

Rogues would be the underdogs in the world of Norrath ... except that they're too sharp to fall into that category. They aren't strong, but they're quick and quiet and have a talent for the unexpected. Where a Warrior breaks down a door, a Rogue scales the wall or pries open a window. When a Paladin flourishes a sword and cries defiance at his enemies, a Rogue silently creeps up behind and slips a thin blade past the ribs and into the heart. Both are effective, but one is much more appropriate to the smaller character who can't bench press a packhorse.

Now, while you can play the Rogue as any type of personality you choose, be aware that the skills a Rogue accumulates as he or she lives and learns tend to be of a certain ... to put it politely ... practicality. A Rogue is part acrobat, part assassin, part thief and a whole lot of swashbuckler. A Rogue can swagger and strut, and then disappear into the shadows. The sheer flexibility of the class makes it a lot of fun for the moderately experienced player. First-time players may be frustrated by the lack of muscle or fireworks, since the Rogue is not ideal for a straightforward lifestyle.

In a party, the Rogue truly shines. She requires the assistance of other characters to realize her true combat potential, which is formidable.

In a group setting, no other melee class has the chance to deal as much damage in a given period of time, and with the support of a more traditional tank, they are able to avoid taking too much damage. They make excellent scouts, being inconspicuous enough to see without being seen. This same ability allows them to become quite adept at corpse recovery as well — they're often able to retrieve fallen comrades from the very feet of monsters.

Unlocking doors is also a forte of the Rogue class, and there will be many places you will adventure that require a Rogue to enter (and exit!). Just remember, although you have the ability to steal from creatures, when in a group this decreases the loot the party receives, and can make you quite unpopular if you abuse this ability.

## Creation Guide

It is important to make good decisions on Race, Starting Stats, and Religion. These things combined will allow you to create the Rogue that makes you most happy.

### Choosing Race

Choosing a race for any class can be a difficult decision--do not choose a race based on abilities alone. Choose the Race that provides you with the right mix of racial benefits, religion, cultural armor sets, and statistics that benefit your class.

Wood Elves, Dark Elves and Gnomes all have low strength however which is a large hindrance to to the overall damage output of the class. Barbarians and Dwarves on the other hand have quite high strength which is a definite bonus.

Halflings level slightly faster than the other rogue races, whilst Barbarians level slightly slower. Barbarians do however get the ability to slam their enemies both interrupting casting and giving a short stun. They can also wear both large and medium armour, and use the large race throwing weapons.

Barbarians and Humans are the only races with no night vision, however you can find items in the game which will remove this deficiency. You should also note that Dark Elves are generally hated through most cities of Norrath.

### Starting Statistics

It is important to note that each race has slightly different starting statistics. For Rogues, your STA is important for a larger number of hit points, and STR contributes to your ability to deal damage.

| Race | STR | DEX | AGI | STA | INT | WIS | CHA | Bonus |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Barbarian | 103 | 80 | 92 | 95 | 60 | 70 | 55 | 30 |
| Dark Elf | 60 | 85 | 100 | 65 | 99 | 83 | 60 | 30 |
| Dwarf | 90 | 100 | 80 | 90 | 60 | 83 | 45 | 30 |
| Gnome | 60 | 95 | 95 | 70 | 98 | 67 | 60 | 30 |
| Half-Elf | 70 | 95 | 100 | 70 | 75 | 60 | 75 | 30 |
| Halfling | 70 | 100 | 105 | 75 | 67 | 80 | 50 | 30 |
| Human | 75 | 85 | 85 | 75 | 75 | 75 | 75 | 30 |
| Wood Elf | 65 | 90 | 106 | 65 | 75 | 80 | 75 | 30 |

Each race gets 30 bonus points to apply to the base stats of their choosing.

### Religion

Generally speaking being Agnostic is a fairly safe bet in Everquest. Religion serves only to get you into trouble in many situations. The disadvantage to doing this is that some items, such as deity-specific Cultural armor sets, and some quests can only be done by followers of certain religions. Following a religion will at worst get you killed in some areas, but generally you can avoid these. Following Innoruuk is probably the most dangerous religion as they have the most places in the game where they are Kill on Sight. In the end it will not make an enormous difference to your character which Deity you choose.

# FAQ

## Which weapon-skills should I practice / train?

**Piercing.** Rogues can use a range of one-handed weapons and even a few two-handed ones, but piercing is the rogue's trademark weapon-skill because that's what you need to have in your primary hand if you want to back-stab. What a rogue holds in their off hand is a matter of personal preference, but every rogue should keep their piercing skill in practice.

## What is the evade skill I've heard about and why can't I train it?

Evasion is not a skill in the normal sense of the word, it's a trick that rogues can manage by using hide to lower their aggro in combat. A rogue simply exits combat and presses their hot-key for the Hide skill. Most rogues set up a hot-key macro to do this.

Evade does not completely remove aggro, and it does not work when soloing.

> Evade was added February 17, 2000 in the Paineel Era:{.is-info}

> A new rogue-specific ability has been added to the "Hide" skill. It is called "Evade". This skill has the effect of lowering the amount that the targeted NPC hates the rogue, and has the potential of making the engaged NPC switch to another target (preferably a tank) within the rogue's group. It is essentially a "reverse taunt". This ability helps 
mitigate the negative effects of the rogue's exceedingly high damage-output potential. It also will in-turn help the rogue do even more damage as the NPC is much more likely to expose its back. It is engaged by targeting the NPC you wish to "Evade" and pressing the "Hide" button. As a note, you must not be in combat mode in order to use this ability.

## How does stealth work?

The simple version? Stand very still, press hide to hide yourself from view and then press sneak. Unlike other classes, rogues are told if they succeeded or not. If both skills worked, you are now invisible to 99% of mobs on the server as though someone had cast Invisibility and Invisibility versus Undead on you. You'll also walk slowly, but that's a small price to pay for the most reliable and effective form of invisibility in the game (your strafe speed will not be affected).

Some creatures can see through the Hide skill, most of them rogues, so you should still be careful, but many a low-level rogue has wandered into Lower Guk or Chardok unseen.

## What are these masks people keep talking about?

There are four masks in the game which allow a rogue or bard to disguise themselves as a member of another race; these masks give minor stat boosts and can be clicked from the inventory:

- **Guise of the Coercer** (High Elf)
- **Mask of Deception** (Dark Elf)
- **Iksar Hide Mask** (Iksar)
- **Mask of Obtenebration** (Erudite)

There are also three masks which were added later in the Velious era or were available for only a brief period:

- **Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask** (Barbarian)
- **Desiccated Halfling Mask** (Halfling)
- **Mask of Tinkering** (Gnome)

## Where do I buy poisons?

You can't. Some poisons are given as rewards for quests, others can be looted from a very small number of NPCs, but the normal way to acquire poisons (once you are level 18 and able to use them) is to make them yourself from a variety of rare and dangerous compounds. You'll want to take a look at the Make Poison page for more information on that.

## Where do I buy poison-making supplies?

Unfortunately, unlike most normal tradeskills, the poison-making vendors do not frequent any of the starting cities. In fact, with the exception of a vendor named Toxdil in the tunnels under Freeport, there is no old-world city with a poison vendor. Here is the current list of every known vendor selling poison-making supplies:

| Location | Vendor | Coordinates |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Dagnor's Cauldron | Conium Darkblade | (-236, -826) |
| Firiona Vie | Brak Daggermist | (-3608, 2359) |
| West Freeport | Toxdil | (623, 200) |
| Lake of Ill Omen | Nubs Blackgranite | (-2517, -2920) |
| Western Plains of Karana | Gindlin Toxfodder | (-2986, -13398) |

## Are Poison Vials and Suspensions meant to be that expensive?

Yes, you really will be spending over 2pp just on vials and suspensions. That's why so many rogues learn how to make their own.

## Does Dexterity increase my hit rate?

Dexterity has been shown to increase hit rate in PVP, but there is no evidence it increases hit rate in PVE.
