  # Warrior Guide

> A Warrior is a master of armed combat, in all of its forms. He's at home on the battlefield, and is trained to take as much punishment as he doles out.
 By nature, Warriors have more health points than any other class.

## Description

Warriors are the epitome of a tank class. They wield weapons in both hands, wear finely crafted armors, and are able to absorb massive amounts of damage easily. They have high hit points and armor class right from the start. As they gain knowledge of the arts of war, they acquire the skills of Bash, Dual Wield, Double Attack, Parry, Riposte, Dodge and Disarm. They are the only class that learns all of these combat skills, and nearly always as soon or sooner than any other class.

Despite these combat skills, Warriors are not a class with a lifelong ability to solo. At low levels, they can solo easily, but when they enter their low twenties they begin to lose that edge. Since they have no magical abilities of their own, and a lot of hit points to lose, recovering after battle without the aid of a healer is a slow process. By level 25 they will not survive many White fights without a backup healer. Because of this, the Warrior needs groups. Fortunately, groups need Warriors just as badly.

The Warriors' duty in a group is not only to absorb damage, but also to pull for the group. They have to absorb damage from a mob as they lead it to their group. In combat proper, a Warrior should be adept at keeping an eye on the rest of the group. He must keep the mobs off of the lighter-armored classes, or it can be disastrous for the entire group. While most of the combat functions of the Warrior are automated, this does not mean the Warrior is a boring class to play. The art of tagging and pulling mobs is in itself a challenging role, and a very important one at higher levels.

Warriors are a very straightforward class that rely heavily on their party in order to perform well. A Warrior will want to become good friends with a Cleric early in life, and develop a trusting relationship between them, as it will be the [Cleric](/character/classes/cleric) who keeps her alive in the levels to come. This class is a fun one to play â€” Warriors get to beat things up and laugh in the enemys' face.

## Creation Guide

It is important to make good decisions on Race, Starting Stats, and Religion. These things combined will allow you to create the Warrior that makes you most happy.

### Choosing Race

Choosing a race for any class can be a difficult decision--do not choose a race based on abilities alone. Choose the Race that provides you with the right mix of racial benefits, religion, cultural armor sets, and statistics that benefit your class.

#### Racial Abilities

**Experience modifiers**: *Until the [January 14, 2001 producer's letter](/lore/producers_letter_20010114) during the Scars of Velious expansion*, Trolls and Iksar had a 20% penalty, Ogres 15%, and Barbarians 5%, while Halflings get a 5% bonus. Warriors as a class get a 10% experience bonus.

**Frontal Stun Immunity**: Ogres are the only race in Everquest which are immune to all stun effects from their frontal arc. This is a huge benefit while tanking.

**Regeneration**: Trolls and Iksar possess natural health regeneration.

**Slam**: Ogres, Trolls, Barbarians (the large races) have the ability to bash without a shield equipped. This can interrupt spell-casting.

**Hide**: Dark Elves, Halflings, and Wood Elves have the ability to hide.

**Reputation**: Your race will determine how NPC's perceive you, and which cities you are allowed to enter. Dark Elves, Ogres, Trolls, and especially Iksar are hated in most civilized parts of Norrath.

**Armor**: Large races can not wear medium or small armor, and vice versa. Some races can wear two types, such as Barbarians who can wear Large and Medium. Iksar can not wear plate until Velious but get an innate bonus which is added directly to the soft cap. Additionally, Iksar can not use the utility clicks for the Kunark plate equipment like the shrink bracers.

**Night Vision**: Barbarian and Human Warriors have poor night vision, and without a light source, magic armor, or buffs, navigating the world early-game will be harder.

**Forage**: Wood Elves and Iksar can forage for food.

**Tinker**: Gnome Warriors have access to a unique Trade-Skill, which can be quite useful for Warriors, called Tinkering.

### Starting Statistics

It is important to note that each race has slightly different starting statistics. For Warriors, your STA is important for a larger number of hit points, and AGI contributes to your AC.

| Race | STR | DEX | AGI | STA | INT | WIS | CHA | Bonus |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Barbarian | 113 | 70 | 87 | 105 | 60 | 70 | 55 | 25 |
| Dark Elf | 70 | 75 | 95 | 75 | 99 | 83 | 80 | 25 |
| Dwarf | 100 | 90 | 75 | 100 | 60 | 83 | 45 | 25 |
| Gnome | 70 | 85 | 90 | 80 | 98 | 67 | 60 | 25 |
| Half-Elf | 80 | 85 | 95 | 80 | 75 | 60 | 75 | 25 |
| Halfling | 80 | 90 | 100 | 85 | 67 | 80 | 50 | 25 |
| Human | 85 | 75 | 80 | 85 | 75 | 75 | 75 | 25 |
| Ogre | 140 | 70 | 75 | 132 | 60 | 67 | 37 | 25 |
| Troll | 118 | 75 | 88 | 119 | 52 | 60 | 40 | 25 |
| Wood Elf | 75 | 80 | 100 | 75 | 75 | 80 | 75 | 25 |

Each race gets 25 bonus points to apply to the base stats of their choosing.

#### Suggested Starting Statistics

The main focus of warriors is to sustain as much damage as possible. Here are our suggestions:

> **Allocation Recommendations**
Ogre: Add 18 Stamina (max), 7 Dexterity
Other Races: Add 25 Stamina

##### Min-maxing Starting Stats

Aside from Stamina, stats are relatively easy to max at end-game Velious, so it is recommended to dump as many points into Stamina as possible. A Shaman can only buff one spell to increase Stamina (Riotous Health 50 STA) while both Focus of Spirit (HP 405, STR 67, DEX 60) and Avatar (STR, AGI, DEX and ATK by 100) stack capping your Strength & Dexterity. Agility can easily be raised above the soft-cap of 75, additional agility provides only incremental AC bonuses.

### Experience Statistics

Warriors get a **10% bonus to experience** gains when leveling. However, race selection may involve additional modifiers to experience (*until penalties were removed during Velious*):

| Race | Modifier |
|------|----------|
| Troll | 20% penalty |
| Ogre | 15% penalty |
| Barbarian | 5% penalty |
| Halfling | 5% bonus |

With all factors accounted for, the actual experience modifiers for each warrior race comes out to the following:

* Barbarian Warrior: +5.5%
* Dark Elf Warrior: +10%
* Dwarf Warrior: +10%
* Gnome Warrior: +10%
* Half-Elf Warrior: +10%
* Halfling Warrior: +14.5%
* Human Warrior: +10%
* Iksar Warrior: -8%
* Ogre Warrior: -3.5%
* Troll Warrior: -8%
* Wood Elf Warrior: +10%

**What does it mean?**

Certain races and classes require differing amounts of experience points to attain the same level. For example, a Halfling Warrior requires 85.5% of the experience that a Human Cleric would require to be the same level. An Ogre Warrior would require 103.5% of the experience that the Human Cleric would.

> Class-based experience penalties were removed in the January 17, 2001 patch on live during the Scars of Velious expansion. While this change was not explicitly mentioned in those patch notes, it was mentioned in the [January 14, 2001 producer's letter](/lore/producers_letter_20010114) in which Gordon Wrinn stated they would be "going in next patch." The experience bonuses for Rogues and Warriors was left in so that the changes wouldn't be interpreted as a nerf, and because they weren't enough to be considered unbalancing. {.is-info}

### Religion

Generally speaking being Agnostic is a fairly safe bet in Everquest. Religion serves only to get you into trouble in many situations. The disadvantage to doing this is that some items, such as deity-specific Cultural armor sets, and some quests can only be done by followers of certain religions. Following a religion will at worst get you killed in some areas, but generally you can avoid these. Following Innoruuk is probably the most dangerous religion as they have the most places in the game where they are Kill on Sight. In the end it will not make an enormous difference to your character which Deity you choose.

#### Deity Specific Armor

* Cazic-Thule-only Warrior Armor
* Rallos Zek-only Warrior Armor
* Innoruuk-only Warrior Armor

## Skills

### Berserker Frenzy (Warrior Ability)

Going into a berserker frenzy is an innate, passive ability of the warrior class that is present from level 1 onward. Anytime a player character warrior's health falls too low, he or she enters a berserker frenzy, converting all of his or her critical hits into more powerful crippling blows.

A warrior will go berserk when falling below 40% health and will remain berserk permanently until his or her health reaches 45%. While berserk, the warrior will score a crippling blow whenever they would normally have scored a critical hit. Going berserk is accompanied by the message, "Soandso goes into a berserker frenzy!" which will appear in the chat boxes of both the warrior and any other nearby players. "Soandso is no longer berserk" signals the end of the effect.

Berserking is a hard-coded mechanic of the class and stacks with all buffs, disciplines, etc.

### Magic Resistance

Warriors will gain a progressively stronger resistance to magic as they level, at a rate of +1 MR every 2 levels.

### Primary Hand Damage Bonuses

This is the same for all melee classes, but listed here for reference.

- Level 28: 1
- Level 31: 2
- Level 34: 3
- Level 37: 4
- Level 40: 5
- Level 43: 6
- Level 46: 7
- Level 49: 8
- Level 52: 9
- Level 55: 10
- Level 58: 11
