Guardians of nature, Druids are one of the most versatile classes in Norrath. Druids are a priest class, which means that they have the powerful ability to heal themselves and others. Their connection with nature means animals love them, and many an otherwise- hostile animal will allow a Druid to pass unharmed through its territory. High-level Druids are eventually able to transform themselves and others into wolves.

Although Druids can channel the peaceful and healing touch of nature, they can also summon nature's fearsome wrath. Druids have powerful fire and lightning damage spells — so powerful that, at certain points in their development, they are second only to Wizards in their damage-dealing abilities, even outpacing the mighty Magician. Druids can also summon swarms of bees that deal damage over time to their foes. Defensively, the Druid can surround himself or his allies in thorny shields that pierce any enemy that dares attack the person behind it.

Some would argue that the Druid's greatest strength is in his mastery of movement. Druids can call up nature's lupine spirits and bless themselves or others with the Spirit of Wolf, enabling them to run at great speed. Conversely, even the newly apprenticed Druid has the ability to slow down his foes, reducing their speed to a crawl. However, the Druid's most powerful movement ability lies in the teleport line of spells, without question. Druids may teleport themselves or others to selected areas throughout Norrath, covering the distance of a day's journey in a single instant.

Although a Druid's melee abilities pale compared to those of a Warrior, he is competent in armed combat. Druids are the only caster class in the game able to wield swords, although they are limited to the use of scimitars. The offensive might of the Druid does not come without a price — Druids may only wear armor of cloth and leather, and are forbidden from using chain mail and plate to protect themselves.

# Creation Guide

It is important to make good decisions on Race, Starting Stats, and Religion. These things combined will allow you to create the Druid that makes you most happy.

## Choosing Race

**Half Elf**

Half Elves are the least wise of the Druidic races. They have decent melee stats, but most Druids will not be doing much melee in later levels. However, there are many Wisdom-enhancing items to be found in Norrath, and even a Half Elf can increase his Wisdom to 200. Half Elves have the greatest choice in starting selection, as they may start in Surefall or in Kelethin. Half Elves wear medium-sized armor.

**Halfling**

These small and hairy creatures are very close to nature, and it is no surprise that they make excellent Druids. By nature extremely agile, dexterous and wise, they also have very good Strength and Stamina, and require less XP to level. Halflings also have the natural ability to Hide and Sneak, invaluable tools when it becomes necessary to Meditate safely in dangerous areas. The only drawback of a Halfling Druid — and it's minor — is his low Charisma. Halflings begin in Rivervale, with a nice newbie area central to Norrath. Halflings wear small armor.

**Human**

The strongest Druid race, and only a little less wise than the Elves and Halflings, Humans are an uncommon, but very solid, race choice for a Druid. Humans may begin in Surefall Glade, a small Druid and Ranger haven in the Qeynos hills. Humans have decent stats all across the board. They excel at nothing but are not weak in any area either. Humans lack infravision, and so may need a light source at lower levels for night or underground adventuring. Humans, like Half Elves, wear medium-sized armor.

**Wood Elf**

Wood Elves make excellent Druids. While not quite as strong or dexterous as Halflings, they are just as wise. Wood Elves have the natural ability to Forage (although all Druids eventually gain this ability). Wood Elves begin in Kelethin on the continent of Faydwer. They have the advantage of being able to wear either small- or medium-sized armor.

## Starting Statistics

| Race | STR | DEX | AGI | STA | INT | WIS | CHA | Bonus |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Half Elf | 70 | 85 | 90 | 80 | 75 | 70 | 75 | 30 |
| Halfling | 70 | 90 | 95 | 85 | 67 | 90 | 50 | 30 |
| Human | 75 | 75 | 75 | 85 | 75 | 85 | 75 | 30 |
| Wood Elf | 65 | 80 | 95 | 75 | 75 | 90 | 75 | 30 |

## Spending Your Bonus Points

Here are our suggested allocations of your bonus points at creation:

- **Wood Elf:** Add 25 to Wisdom, 5 to Stamina.
- **Half Elf:** Add 25 to Wisdom, 5 to Stamina.
- **Halfling:** Add 25 to Wisdom, 5 to Stamina.
- **Human:** Add 25 to Wisdom, 5 to Stamina.

Also you can spend those 5 points into STR if you wish to carry more loot, but in general Stamina = More hitpoints, important for low levels (where druids do melee decently). Also a lot of the druid Equipment does not grant Stamina. Also note that druids can buff STR considerably, as well as port to bank very easily, so being encumbered is usually not an issue.

## Religion

Religion does not play an overly important role to Druids, but they do affect whether the druid can use certain deity-specific items.

| Race | Tunare | Karana |
|------|--------|--------|
| Wood Elf | Yes | No |
| Halfling | No | Yes |
| Human | Yes | Yes |
| Half-Elf | Yes | Yes |

*All Wood Elf druids must worship Tunare, while all Halflings must worship Karana. Half-Elves and Humans can choose between the two.*

# Skills

## Specialization

Druids have three choices of specialization:

1. **Conjuration** (DoT spells, good for solo Druids) - mainly useful for druids who kite, as it is the basis for their low-resist DoT line (Stinging Swarm, etc). As the primary means of damage for a druid kiting or root-rotting individual mobs, this can save you considerable mana and make you much more effective.

2. **Alteration** (buffs, healing and gates) - the basis of a druid's teleports, roots, certain buffs (SoW, strength), as well as their charms, heals and regeneration spells. Because of how frequently these spells are cast, especially in a group, Alteration is a very viable choice for druids.

3. **Evocation** (DD spells — big mana burners) - the basis of all the druid DD spells. These are quite mana hungry, and druids certainly get some nasty spells in this line. Evocation is good for both grouping (as DPS) and soloing druids.

Choosing among these three groups of spells can be difficult for you. The only suggestion we can give here is for party Druids to specialize in Alteration. Other than that, you need to consider how you want to play and choose along those lines.

# Pet Information

| Spell | Level | Pet Level | Pet Class | ~HP | Max Hit | Kick/Bash Dmg |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----------|-----|---------|----------------|
| Nature Walkers Behest | 55 | 23-28 | Warrior | 200-300 | 20-30 | 30 |

This pet is not very useful as a standard pet. Some Druids use it together with clicky Reclaim Energy items as a way to store mana. (It is a good guard pet in low level zones while afk) The above stats were collected from a live server and may be inaccurate if there were ever any updates pertaining to this pet.
