Necromancers are the Death Magi of Norrath. They seek out darkness and evil, and thrive when surrounded by pain and death. Necromancers are the masters of the dead, reaching beyond the bounds of the grave to magically manipulate their dark minions.

Wholly dedicated to the practice of their magic, Necromancers are physically weak and unable to provide much of a defense. Due to their lack of physical prowess, they have developed spells that enable them to command powerful undead beings, and have their own peculiar spells that summon loyal servants to do their bidding. Their main offensive spells focus on time-based means of dealing with their opponents. These spells generally draw on pain and suffering and are grounded in poison and disease, causing their enemies to suffer and perish in terrible ways. This mastery of torment lets Necromancers suck the very life out of their victims and heal themselves in the process. However, pain is a means to an end, rather than an end in itself, and a Necromancer will even inflict suffering on himself to restore magical energies, if that is the most efficient way to accomplish his goals.

Necromancers are considered evil merely because they choose to delve into the arts and practices that many find repulsive. Even if a Necromancer's goals are aligned with the forces of Light, few would think that these ends can justify their foul means. Necromancers are oftentimes shunned in the world because of their peculiar looks and ways, but none doubt the powers of the Necromancer, for they are the stuff of nightmares.

Although a Necromancer might have a personal preference for the comradeship of others, she is fully powerful enough to face the world and triumph, with only her pet at her side. It is just as well that the Necromancer can fend for herself, for unless her race is evil she is not well liked even among her own kind. In many cases she is an outcast, and branded a heretic. The Erudites, for example, ostracize Necromancers from their home town, forcing them to live in caverns and deep within forests. Even though labeled a heretic, there is usually someone who can use the services of a Necromancer, especially anyone who is searching for a lost corpse. It can be very easy to lose a corpse, especially when you are exploring a new area and are in unfamiliar surroundings. A Necromancer's skills include the ability to locate someone's corpse, and even in some cases summon it, although at quite a high price.

The Necromancer is one of the most difficult classes, due to the many different ways in which it may be played, but in the end can be one of the most gratifying. Because of the hostilities toward Necromancers, it can be difficult to purchase supplies without long and time-consuming journeys. Expect to use people skills to make friends who'll purchase supplies for you from the local stores, or more often than not you'll go hungry.

# Creation Guide

It is important to make good decisions on Race, Starting Stats, and Religion. These things combined will allow you to create the Necromancer that makes you most happy.

## Choosing Race

Choosing a race for any class can be a difficult decision--do not choose a race based on abilities alone. Choose the Race that provides you with the right mix of racial benefits, religion, cultural armor sets, and statistics that benefit your class. Here are some considerations for your Necromancer:

| Race | Benefit | Detractor |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Dark Elf** | Master race, hide/sneak, Ultravision, high starting intelligence, Thex Mallet Quest | So-called "good" vendors may not trade at lower levels, difficult to build faction compared to more neutral races, Lower charisma |
| **Erudite** | Many class-specific quests (Noclin's Femur Quest), highest starting intelligence, high charisma | Poor night vision |
| **Gnome** | High starting int, Small size is handy in dungeons, Infravision, easiest "evil" faction fixes, Tinkering | Lower Charisma |
| **Human** | Well-rounded starting stats, Highest Charisma | Poor night vision, Low starting intelligence |
| **Iksar** | Forage, natural AC Bonus, Health Regen Bonus, Infravision | Hated in all cities except own (even evil cities), Racial experience penalty of 20%, Low starting Int, Lowest Starting Cha |

*Note: All Necromancers had a 10% class-based experience penalty until the January 14, 2001 patch on EQLive. When combined with the Iksar racial experience penalty, this becomes 32% (110% * 120%).*

## Starting Statistics

It is important to note that each race has slightly different starting statistics. For Necromancers, your INT is important for a larger mana pool, and STA contributes to your overall available hitpoints (which means more mana by using lich). You will likely find that it is easiest to max INT if you pursue raiding and high-end gear, however, so depending on your play style you may wish to allocate more points to STA.

| Race | STR | DEX | AGI | STA | INT | WIS | CHA | Bonus |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Dark Elf | 60 | 85 | 90 | 65 | 109 | 83 | 60 | 30 |
| Erudite | 60 | 80 | 70 | 70 | 117 | 83 | 70 | 30 |
| Gnome | 60 | 95 | 85 | 70 | 108 | 67 | 60 | 30 |
| Human | 75 | 85 | 75 | 75 | 85 | 75 | 75 | 30 |
| Iksar | 70 | 95 | 90 | 70 | 85 | 80 | 55 | 30 |

Each race gets 30 bonus points to apply to the base stats of their choosing.

## Religion

Religion is not of a huge concern to Necromancers as they are already hated. Most choose to worship either Cazic-Thule, or Innoruuk the Prince of Hate, as it fits their role. Necromancers cannot be agnostic, as their dark powers are directly linked to their worship of their god.

Innoruuk is the best choice for faction in Neriak, which is the most convenient city for newer non-Iksar Necromancers.

Iksars are limited to choosing Cazic-Thule.

# Skills

See also Languages for a skill listing of available Languages.

## Spell Specialization Skill

Necromancers have three choices of Specialization: Alteration, Evocation and Conjuration.

**Alteration** is a popular choice. It covers DoT, Lifetap and Undead Charm spells. These spells are your bread and butter, especially if you would like to solo.

**Evocation** is a lesser choice, as Necromancers get very few Direct Damage nukes. You may find this a useful choice if you intend to join a raiding guild and want to contribute to faster DPS.

**Conjuration** is also a lesser choice. It covers pet summoning, as well as your Darkness and Disease spells.

# Pet Information

## Focus Item

The only pet focus item that Necromancers can obtain is the Encyclopedia Necrotheurgia. Similar to the Magician pet focus items, this focus item makes the pet larger in size. It also provides a +1 level bonus to all summoned pets from spell levels 46-60. This allows for pets that can exceed the hit points, melee, and spell damage listed in the tables. The +1 level is added to the RNG of the level of pet you would have summoned. When you finish casting a pet spell, RNG will determine the level of pet you summoned in that pet's level range. If using the focus item for that pet, the pet's level will be RNG+1.

As an example, the Emissary of Thule pet has a level range of 43-47. When you cast that spell, at the end of the cast RNG determines the pet level to be level 47. If you are using the focus item, it adds +1 to the RNG so the pet would be level 48.
