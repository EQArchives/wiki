Enchanters’ spells and research focus on manipulation of the mind, and this mental acuity gives Enchanters more spells than any other class. The trademark Enchanter spell line lets them cloak themselves in illusion. They can charm more different creatures than any other class, overwhelming their target’s mind and bending it to their will. They can hold creatures mesmerized and enthralled, unable to act. They can stun the minds of others, sometimes using a combination of spells that leaves their victim virtually unable to fight back. Enchanters are the only class on Norrath that can buff mental prowess. With the discovery of Kunark, Enchanters gained a full line of mana regeneration spells. At the highest levels they can steal creatures’ magical energy for themselves, much as Necromancers steal life. Enchanters have the best haste spells and can debuff many attributes, including magic resistance and attack speed. Plus, Enchanters have pets.

With all this going for them, there has to be a catch, right? Well there is, and it’s a big one. A skilled Enchanter is indispensable to a group, but an inattentive Enchanter gets a group killed faster than you can /shout“Train!” With so many spells to choose from, it’s critical that the Enchanter memorize spells appropriate for her current adventure. And even an experienced Enchanter may still get a group killed if she gets an unlucky series of resisted spells while trying for crowd control.

Like all casters, Enchanters have low hit points and laughable defense. They also have no method of healing themselves. The animated sword-and-shield pet is less powerful than other classes’ pets, with lower hit points and slower hit point regeneration (though fairly good damage). The pet does not accept commands from the Enchanter; it only defends once she is attacked. Figuring out how to make good use of the pet can be a challenge, and some Enchanters don’t use their pets at all, relying on their charms instead.

In the teen- and even mid-levels, Enchanters may have to educate their groups about what they can offer besides the ever-popular Breeze/Clarity and Quickness/Augmentation buffs. Mainly this means teaching the rules of enthrall and AE mesmerize — the group must have a designated tank, and all others in the group must /assist this tank, so the mezzed creatures are not attacked prematurely. Unfortunately, sometimes group members have had bad experiences with unskilled Enchanters, and it may take effort to convince the group to do what you ask and trust that you can keep them safe.

Enchanters shine in groups, and are often only thought of as a group support character. In actuality, Enchanters are perfectly capable of soloing. They can use Root-Nuke tactics, though not as efficiently as a Wizard. They can Reverse-Kite like Necromancers, but would be wise to purchase SoW potions first, since they lack a slow spell. They can fight using their pet or a charmed creature, but again, this is riskier than a Magician soloing with his pet.

## Creation Guide
It is important to make good decisions on Race, Starting Stats, and Religion. These things combined will allow you to create the Enchanter that makes you most happy. 

### Choosing Race
#### Dark Elf

Dark Elves have high Intelligence but low Charisma. They have ultravision, and they get the Hide skill as well, which is fantastic when you need to break charms sort-of on demand. Dark Elf Enchanters have easier access to the enchant metal line of spells, which can only be purchased in Neriak. The big drawback to this race is that they are hated by most others on Norrath, while at the same time Enchanters are not very well liked by other Dark Elves (they think all casters should become Necromancers). Illusion spells can do much to mitigate racial hatred problems for agnostic Dark Elves. Players who prefer to be of the Dark Elf race sometimes choose the Enchanter class because their faction-altering spells make the racial tensions easier to bear.

#### Erudite

The Enchanter’s craft is perfectly matched to the Erudite race, which has an ivory-tower attitude and the highest natural Intelligence of any race. Erudite Charisma is high as well, and this plus judicious use of spells convinces most merchants to offer you a better price than they give to others of your snobbish race. Enchanters also get spells that bestow infravision and eventually ultravision, which compensates for the Erudites having no natural night vision.

#### Gnome

Gnomes have high Intelligence but low Charisma. Pick Gnome if you happen to like playing a small race. If anyone makes short jokes at your expense, get your revenge by scaring them with a Barbarian or Ogre illusion! Gnomes have infravision and can Tinker, a trade skill reserved for their race.

#### High Elf

High Elves have the highest Charisma of any race, and have high Intelligence as well. They have infravision, and are a popular choice for Enchanters.

#### Human

There’s not much positive here — Humans have significantly lower Intelligence than other Enchanter races, and poor night vision is a disadvantage at lower levels (Enchanters get infravision and ultravision buffs later in life). However, their Charisma is higher than all but the High Elf’s.

### Starting Statistics
| Race | STR | DEX | AGI | STA | INT | WIS | CHA | Bonus |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Dark Elf | 60 | 75 | 90 | 65 | 109 | 83 | 70 | 30 |
| Erudite | 60 | 70 | 70 | 70 | 117 | 83 | 80 | 30 |
| Gnome | 60 | 85 | 85 | 70 | 108 | 67 | 70 | 30 |
| High Elf | 55 | 70 | 85 | 65 | 102 | 95 | 90 | 30 |
| Human | 75 | 75 | 75 | 75 | 85 | 75 | 85 | 30 |

### Religion
Enchanters should, unless they are role-playing, always choose to be agnostic. In some areas your illusion will not be enough to keep you alive. In some areas you will still be Kill on Sight for any number of reasons, though these are very few indeed. If you choose to be agnostic you virtually eliminate the risk of being murdered on a religious background. 

### Specialization
The first specialization a young Enchanter might consider is Abjuration. This skill is all about buffing shield spells. Conjuration (used to summon animations as well as for some combat spells) and Divination (the key for all the illusion spells) are usually less practical choices initially. The final school an Enchanter would probably want to concentrate on is Alteration, since most of the combat-related spells fall into this category.

By the time they have to choose a single skill in which to specialize beyond level 50, Enchanters really only have two choices — **Alteration** (which includes immobilization, haste, slowing, DoT, charm and most attribute increases and decreases) and **Conjuration** (which includes mesmerizing spells).

Most Enchanters choose **Alteration** as their field of specialization, since half of their spells are related to this skill.
