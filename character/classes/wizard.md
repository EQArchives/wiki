Wizards are the undisputed masters of damage. This can easily be misunderstood. A Wizard is not a master of all forms of damage, but rather, the master of Direct Damage â€” she has the greatest variety of spells available to her with which to Deal Direct damage. However, Wizards are not the most damaging class overall in a long battle ... a Wizard's strength lies in making the battle a quick and painless one.

Wizards are the only class that possess Direct Damage spells in all three categories: cold, heat and magic. Wizards also get the most powerful area-effect Direct Damage spells. These spells are relatively unlikely to taunt a mob, so they rarely draw a targeted mob to their Wizardly source, especially if the Wizard is grouped with Enchanters and good tanks. Area effect spells are by far the most mana-efficient spells in the game and, in the right situations, add to the power of the Wizard. A Wizard who knows how to recognize such situations is truly wise indeed, and worthy of all the respect this class demands.

At level 35, Wizards get a noticeable enhancement to their spells. Their spells become much more difficult to resist, especially for monsters that con white and yellow. Wizards also get a nice line of stun spells that add to the efficiency of their class, especially in a group.

Wizards are also noted for their teleportation spells. These spells make them very fast travelers, and very much desired throughout Norrath. With a timely teleport, they can save an entire party, evacuating the group from a tight corner. Druids can also teleport, but Wizards alone acquire the spells that make them the gatekeepers of the planes of Fear and Hate (of course, such travel usually comes at a high price).

Wizards are the only pure casting class that lack a pet. As such, they are generally forced to use the "Root 'n' Nuke" technique at lower levels. As the Wizard gains levels and grows, so does his power, but at lower and mid levels, a Wizard can be very frustrating to play.

The true challenge for a Wizard lies in acquiring the knowledge of what spells work best against which NPCs. Once in combat, a Wizard is a straightforward class that requires few decisions. It's a good class to play, but maybe a bit repetitive.

# Creation Guide

It is important to make good decisions on Race, Starting Stats, and Religion. These things combined will allow you to create the Wizard that makes you most happy.

## Choosing Race

**Dark Elf**

Dark Elves make good Wizards for numerous reasons. Their Intelligence is high, and they have decent Agility and Dexterity, which are both good secondary attributes for the class. They also can see in the dark better than any other race. The one drawback to Dark Elves is that they are not liked by most other races. This can make their lives difficult, to say the least.

**Erudite**

Erudites make great Wizards, if only because of their excellent Intelligence. None of their other stats is all that low, but nothing to be proud of, either. They are more widely accepted than Dark Elves, but lack night vision until they acquire Heat Sight (level 16).

**Gnome**

Gnomes might make the best Wizards in the game. Their only low stats are Wisdom and Charisma (neither of which a Wizard worries much about) and Strength (which can be boosted with 5 bonus points and various buffing items). They are accepted by most races, they can Tinker, and they can see in the dark. This makes them a wise choice for a Wizard.

**High Elf**

High Elves make good Wizards, but their stats are a pace behind the Gnomes' stats in nearly every important category. Like Gnomes, they are accepted by most races and can see in the dark. Don't let the Gnomes' slight advantage dissuade you if you want to play a traditional elven spellcaster.

**Human**

Humans are not the best choice for Wizards, but their well-rounded stats can provide a solid foundation to build upon. They start out lower on the Intelligence scale, but they help balance that deficiency with their other stats. Add a few Intelligence-buffing items, and there's no reason a Human can't make the 200 Intelligence cap in due time. Like the Erudite, they have no night vision until they acquire Heat Sight.

## Experience Penalties

Until the January 17, 2001 patch during the Scars of Velious expansion, Wizards suffered a 10% class-based experience penalty. While not stated explicitly in the patch, Gordon Wrinn stated they would be "going in next patch." in his January 14, 2001 Producer's Letter.

Accordingly, the 10% experience penalty for Wizards is active on FVProject Classic and Kunark servers.

## Starting Statistics

| Race | STR | DEX | AGI | STA | INT | WIS | CHA | Bonus |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Dark Elf | 60 | 75 | 90 | 75 | 109 | 83 | 60 | 30 |
| Erudite | 60 | 70 | 70 | 80 | 117 | 83 | 70 | 30 |
| Gnome | 60 | 85 | 85 | 80 | 108 | 67 | 60 | 30 |
| High Elf | 55 | 70 | 85 | 75 | 102 | 95 | 80 | 30 |
| Human | 75 | 75 | 75 | 85 | 85 | 75 | 75 | 30 |

## Religion

Generally speaking being agnostic is a fairly safe bet in Everquest. Religion serves only to get you into trouble in many situations. The disadvantage to doing this is that some items and some quests can only be done by followers of certain religions. Following a religion will at worst get you killed in some areas, but generally you can avoid these. Following Innoruuk is probably the most dangerous religion as they have the most places in the game where they are Kill on Sight. In the end it will not make an enormous difference to your character which Deity you choose.
