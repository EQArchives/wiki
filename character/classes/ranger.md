Rangers are well known as the "great outdoorsmen" of Norrath. Being 3/4 Warrior and 1/4 Druid, they possess the ability to cast spells and fight head-to-head with whoever crosses their path. Rangers come with a wide variety of skills and spells that make them a very self- sufficient class. They Forage their own food and water, they use their Tracking to find or avoid danger (whichever is more appropriate at the time), and once they hit level 9 their Druidic side comes forth and they are granted spells. Their spells include many utility spells, which make them even more self- sufficient. They can heal and buff themselves during downtime, and use their offensive and defensive magic to aid in defeating their opponents.

A Ranger's mind, body and soul are in tune with Mother Nature, and they may choose either to become a child of Tunare or a follower of the Rainkeeper, Karana. It is their sole duty to preserve and protect the wilderness. Animals of peace will not attack Rangers (except for the occasional frenzied lion that wonders by). Rangers can spend extended amounts of time in the wilderness, and are only briefly seen in towns. They know the lands of Norrath like the back of their hands, and travelers can always rely on a Ranger to know which way to head if they get lost.

Although many melee classes can use a bow, Rangers truly stands out as the most talented in archery. Although their judgement and accuracy with a bow are unsurpassed, they usually prefer to take on their foes up close and personal. Hand to Hand is a Ranger's primary form of combat, followed by her trusty bow, which she uses to distract, pull and take down escaping foes. Most Rangers take on the trade skill of Blacksmithing, to craft their own armor, but their most popular and useful trade is Fletching, which enables them to carve their own bows and arrows, crafting items more powerful and accurate then anything they could buy at a market.

Rangers make excellent pullers for groups. With the combination of Tracking, Harmony, Snare and their bow, they can pull exactly what they intend to. They can find the mobs that will give their group the best experience or loot, and maybe even that rare spawn that holds a unique item ... if it's out there, a Ranger will know before anyone else. When the group is resting, Rangers use their keen senses to scout for any danger that might compromise the safety of their party. Rangers make good tanks in groups, especially by the time they've accumulated a slew of useful skills and spells â€” Dual Wield and Double Attack, along with a combination of stat and armor buffs (especially their damage shields).

Being a hybrid class, Rangers are limited on both ends when it comes to fighting and spellcasting. Although they make good tanks, Rangers will not have as much armor class and hit points as a Warrior, and are also limited in what armor and weapons they can use. At lower levels most Rangers will use a sword and shield or a two-handed slash weapon, whichever they prefer. Rangers can also wear hand-made banded armor, which will last them until they can obtain better equipment at higher levels. Rangers get spells much later than Druids, and also have a smaller mana pool, so they can't rely too much on spells. They will run dry of mana far before a Druid ever would.

### Class Titles

| Level 1-50 | Level 51-54 | Level 55-59 | Level 60 |
|------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Ranger | Pathfinder | Outrider | Warder |

## Creation Guide

It is important to make good decisions on Race, Starting Stats, and Religion. These things combined will allow you to create the Ranger that makes you most happy.

### Choosing Race

Choosing a race for any class can be a difficult decision--do not choose a race based on abilities alone. Choose the Race that provides you with the right mix of racial benefits, religion, cultural armor sets, and statistics that benefit your class. Here are some considerations for your Ranger:

| Race | Benefit | Detractor |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Half-Elf | Good DEX, two starting cities available. | Low WIS requires points added. |
| Human | High STA, Common Tongue | Poor night vision, low DEX |
| Wood Elf | High AGI and WIS, start in Kelethin | lower STR |
| Halfling* | Small size is handy in dungeons, hide/sneak, faster leveling, highest DEX | You look like a halfling |

*Note: The * denotes races that were not originally allowed to be Rangers. While this combination was not possible until the March 19, 2002 patch (4 months after the December 2001 Shadows of Luclin launch).*

### Starting Statistics

It is important to note that each race has slightly different starting statistics. As melee fighters, Strength and Dexterity are the stats that most will concentrate on raising first, followed by Agility, Wisdom, Intelligence and Charisma (however, racial choice can alter these priorities).

| Race | STR | STA | AGI | DEX | WIS | INT | CHA | Total |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Half-Elf | 75 | 80 | 100 | 85 | 65 | 75 | 75 | 555 |
| Human | 80 | 85 | 85 | 75 | 80 | 75 | 75 | 555 |
| Wood Elf | 70 | 75 | 105 | 80 | 85 | 75 | 75 | 565 |
| Halfling | 75 | 85 | 105 | 90 | 85 | 67 | 50 | 557 |

Each race gets 20 bonus points to apply to the base stats of their choosing.

### Experience Penalty

There is a 40% penalty for hybrid classes (which includes Rangers) until the January 17, 2001 patch changes go into effect during the Scars of Velious expansion. While this change was not explicitly mentioned in those patch notes, it was mentioned in the January 14, 2001 Producer's Letter as "going in next patch."

### Religion

Religion does not have a large impact upon the Ranger class. The two choices are Karana or Tunare (except for Wood Elves who must choose Tunare). Picking one will not alienate you from another, so choose whichever appeals to you more. There are occasionally Deity-specific items, however, such as the Helm of the Tracker in Velious.

### Disciplines

Disciplines first appeared in the Ruins of Kunark expansion for pure melee classes. However, Ranger disciplines weren't introduced until the Scars of Velious expansion; they offer short term advantages with a long re-use: These are most useful in dragon/boss encounters.

| Discipline Name | Level Obtained | Description | Duration | Reuse Time | Expansion Available |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Resistant Discipline | 255 (currently unusable) | +10 to all resistances. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as you level. | 1 Min | 72 Min | The Scars of Velious |
| Fearless Discipline | 54 | Immunity to "Fear" and all spells that cause "fear". The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as you level. | 11 Sec | 72 Min | The Scars of Velious |
| Trueshot Discipline | 55 | Imbues your bow with energy, increasing the damage done by each shot [105%] and improving your accuracy. [Increases Archery Skill Check by 12%] | 2 Min | 72 Min | The Scars of Velious |
| Weaponshield Discipline | 60 | Focuses your combat reflexes, allowing you to parry most melee attacks. Parries all melee attacks from the front. | 18 Sec | 72 Min | The Scars of Velious |

## Hybrid Casting

*The following patch message was included in the February 21, 2001 patch on EQ Live just over two months after the launch of The Scars of Velious:*

> Hybrids that cast spells in combat were taking double penalties at higher levels. The casting times of their spells went up, and the amount of melee damage they do per second went up. This results is having to take longer to cast spells, and losing more damage/second for each second taken in casting. To help offset this, Rangers, Paladins and Shadowknights casting non-beneficial spells that have casting times greater than or equal to 3 seconds, now get a 3 % reduction in casting time for each level over 50. 3% at 51, 6% at 52, etc., to 30% at 60. Again, this applies only to non-beneficial spells.
