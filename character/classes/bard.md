 # Bard Guide

Bards are the do-it-all class of Norrath. Wandering minstrels, troubadours and satirists, Bards are equally at home on the battlefield as they are performing songs and plays for the royal courts of Norrath. Through his extensive travels, the Bard has learned from many of Norrath's other classes: He picks locks and sneaks like the Rogue, tracks and forages like the Ranger, safe falls like the Monk, casts spells as well as many Wizards, and dual wields like the Warrior. Although he is not as skilled in any one of these abilities as more specialized classes, he has by far the widest range of skills and abilities of all the adventurers of Norrath.

Bards have the ability to wear plate armor, the sturdiest (and heaviest) of all armor types. The Bard also has an array of weapon skills to choose from, including One-Handed Slashing, Blunt and Piercing weapons.

The Bard's trademark, though, is his ability to play magical songs. Songs are a powerful type of magic unique to the Bard class. Only a couple of these songs require mana, and songs can be played at any time, even in the middle of combat! Most Bard songs affect all members of a Bard's group, multiplying the Bard's usefulness to the group for every additional member that joins. Multiple Bards in the same group can only make things better, as there is no limit to the number of songs in effect at the same time. Even a single skilled Bard can some- times put up to three or four different songs into effect at once.

A Bard is a charismatic and popular jack of all trades. Bards can fill the role of tank in a group lacking a Warrior or Paladin. If the group needs a healer, the Bard's very popular healing songs can help reduce downtime. The Bard can also play the role of Enchanter, by charming and mesmerizing enemies to do his bidding.

In the rare case that the adventuring Bard finds himself without a group of fellow adventurers, he can still draw on his considerable soloing prowess. The Bard's speed songs enables him to run faster than any other class in Norrath, while his direct damage song can hit enemies from a distance.

Although Bards are formidable in offensive combat, with the ability to wield a weapon in each hand, they may also choose to play a musical instrument. Instruments increase the effectiveness of their songs dramatically, and the power of magical instruments can truly swing the tide of a battle.

For those that choose to go the way of player vs. player combat, the Bard is a fearsome class to face in a duel. It is the only class with a limitless supply of magic and this, combined with power in melee combat, makes the bard a truly formidable foe.

## Creation Guide

It is important to make good decisions on Race, Starting Stats, and Religion. These things combined will allow you to create the Bard that makes you most happy.

### Choosing Race

**Human**

The Human Bard is the strongest Bard, and the least dexterous. He has no night vision, and may only wear medium armor. Humans may start in either of the two Human cities, Freeport or Qeynos. Humans also have the highest Stamina, and thus the most hit points, of any Bard race.

**Half-Elf**

Half Elf Bards are the second strongest, and the most dexterous. Half Elves may only wear medium-sized armor, but they share the Infravision ability of their Wood Elf cousins. Half Elves also have the greatest choice of starting location â€” they may start in Kelethin, Freeport or Qeynos.

**Wood Elf**

Wood Elf Bards are the weakest Bards physically, and the second most dexterous. They have the ability to wear small or medium armor to offset their lack of Strength. They have night vision and the ability to Forage at level 1. Wood Elves also have the racial ability to Hide (although all Bards acquire this ability eventually) and are the most agile of Bards. Wood Elves start in the sylvan city of Kelethin, on the continent of Faydwer.

### Starting Statistics

| Race | Str | Sta | Agi | Dex | Wis | Int | Cha | Bonus |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Wood Elf | 70 | 65 | 95 | 90 | 80 | 75 | 85 | 25 |
| Half Elf | 75 | 70 | 90 | 95 | 60 | 75 | 85 | 25 |
| Human | 80 | 75 | 75 | 85 | 75 | 75 | 85 | 25 |

#### Spending Your Bonus Points

Bards have perhaps, the most number of useful stats of any class. Some have a bit more value than others though.

* **Strength** - Affects maximum and average melee damage and also the bard's ability to carry armor and treasure. Bard armor can be heavy and they do melee, albeit not all the time.
* **Stamina** - Affects your total hitpoints. Bards recieve 4HP per stamina at level 60. Players receive very small benefits from stamina at lower level, which scales up as you level up.
* **Agility** - Affects how often melee attacks miss the bard, and lowers the average hit taken. A little.
* **Dexterity** - Affects how often weapons proc, how quickly you learn melee skills and reduces the chance to miss a note, bringing your song to a close (song fizzle). In a test comparing 100 songs on a 60 bard with 100 base DEX, 7 notes were missed. On geared 167 total DEX, 131 songs before a single note was missed.
* **Wisdom** - Affects the speed of general and craft skill gains if higher than Intelligence.
* **Intelligence** - Affects the speed of general and craft skill gains if higher than Wisdom. Increases the size of the bard's mana pool. Only two songs, Solon's Bewitching Bravura and Denon's Desperate Dirge, require mana to cast.
* **Charisma** - Affects bard lull, mesmerize, and charm abilities. However, all songs are on fixed duration (unless it breaks early), meaning duration can never increase past the song's tick-limit. Kelin's Lugubrious Lament (lull) is a fantastic pulling tool, and charm will also be frequently used by a skilled Bard.

**Allocation Recommendations**
* All-Around: 25 points into Dexterity
* Grouping: 25 points into Charisma

### Religion

Generally speaking being agnostic is a fairly safe bet in Everquest. Religion serves only to get you into trouble in many situations. The disadvantage to doing this is that some items and some quests can only be done by followers of certain religions. Following a religion will at worst get you killed in some areas, but generally you can avoid these. In the end it will not make an enormous difference to your character which Deity you choose.

## Disciplines

Bard disciplines were introduced with the Velious expansion; they offer short term advantages with a long re-use: These are most useful in dragon/boss encounters.

Bards **MUST** turn off songs in order to start Disciplines, failure to do so will result in the Discipline being cancelled but the cool-down will still activate.

| Discipline Name | Level Obtained | Description | Duration | Reuse Time | Expansion |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| Resistant Discipline | 51 | +10 to all resistances. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as you level. | 1 Min | 72 Min | The Scars of Velious |
| Fearless Discipline | 54 | Immunity to "Fear" and all spells that cause "fear". The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as you level. | 11 Sec | 72 Min | The Scars of Velious |
| Deftdance Discipline | 55 | Auto dodge attacks from the front and auto dual-wield. | 10 Sec | 72 Min | The Scars of Velious |
| Puretone Discipline | 60 | Makes it as if you are wielding the best instrument of every type, whether or not you are actually wielding an instrument. Increases to 28 modifier, and does work on singing mod. | 4 Min | 72 Min | The Scars of Velious |

Messages for activation and ending:

* Resistant Discipline: Starting: You channel your will into magical resistance. / Ending: Your resistance fades.
