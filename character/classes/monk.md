So you wish to study the ways of the Monk? Imagine a tranquil garden, sounds of water bubbling over a rocky fountain. Men and women move about quietly, whispering if conversation is necessary. They have no need of riches save for a few adornments. They are calm and unassuming. Suddenly an enemy breaks into the serene setting. As one, the quiet Monks spring into action. Hands and feet fly faster than eyes can see. Some wield staffs or other blunt weapons. The intruder has no chance, as the warrior priests use their unique prowess to quickly and efficiently vanquish the prowler. These are the Monks of Quellious and their agnostic brethren.

Far away on a bleak and desolate training ground, lizardlike Monks practice these same skills. They eschew all other races, but have much in common with their Human counterparts. All three of these sects have the same goal, mastery over body and mind for the purpose of defeating an enemy.

Monks have enviable abilities, regardless of their race. Their drive to master their bodies allows them to practice useful skills. They can fall from great heights without taking damage. They have the ability to heal some wounds without the use of bandages or spells, which is unique to their discipline. They can also fight without weapons, though there are stories of very powerful staves obtained in obscure places. Intelligent Monks will keep all their fighting skills up to perfection at all times, in case they have an opportunity to wield one of these fabled weapons.

As a Monk grows older, she gains the ability to hit more often, along with learning more specialized combat techniques. When she has a friendly magic user in the group to enhance her natural skills, she can be referred to as "a Human blender" (the Iksar have their own comparable term).

Another skill that is mastered by the Monks is the ability to feign death. This is perhaps their most important ability. It can allow them to save their entire adventuring party, by remaining behind while their friends escape.

The Monk is intimately aware of the working of his body. Because of this he is loath to wear any armor beyond leather. With few exceptions, all else is shunned by the sect. Weight is also a consideration; beyond 14 stones the Monk loses some of his natural tenacity, so he tends to travel light.

A tailor can make cured silk, which Monks love to wear. It is stylish and light, which is always a concern for Monks. There are also rumors of mesh and woven armor found in the caverns of Guk, but the sentient race of Frogloks are the ones who own it, and for many Monks killing sentient creatures in order to loot their possessions is not acceptable.

The dream of every Monk is to attain the skill and age necessary to enter the Planes of the Gods and kill the fabled Shiverback Gorillas, who are rumored to be the source of Shiverback hides. Other armors are available throughout the lands, but Shiverback armor may be the best Monk-only armor in the lands of Norrath.

A Monk is most effective in a group of adventurers. There is not much that a Monk can defeat on her own, but the Monk is a vital part of a group, as she can pull opponents to the group much more easily than other classes. She is also a significant source of damage. This does have its drawbacks, as it is difficult for other characters to taunt a monster off of a Monk. Again, the Feign Death skill is extremely useful in these situations, for if a monster is fooled by your supposed death, others have a chance of attracting its attention.

Though they are potent among the melee fighters in Norrath, the path of the Monk is not always easy. It takes skill and cunning to follow their path, but the rewards are great. I wish you well, young initiate, as you begin your journey to Grandmaster.

## Creation Guide

It is important to make good decisions on Race, Starting Stats, and Religion. These things combined will allow you to create the Monk that makes you most happy.

### Choosing Race

**Human**

*Note: This will be the only choice in Classic Everquest until the first expansion releases, The Ruins of Kunark.*

Humans level-up 20% faster than Iksar Monks, and have slightly more base hitpoints. They can enter all good cities in Norrath, but they have no night vision and lower dexterity and agility than the Iksar. Humans can do slightly more damage than Iksars at their full power, though this is only true when using Hand to Hand (without Celestial Fists).

**Iksar**

*Only available on servers with The Ruins of Kunark expansion enabled.*

They have an innate boost to their armor class (AC) which stacks with the natural Monk AC boost. They also have faster health regeneration, infravision, and the ability to forage (although this ability is capped). They also start with 100 skill in swimming. Because of all these bonus abilities, they do slightly less damage than Humans at their full power, though this is only true when using Hand to Hand (without Celestial Fists). They are generally killed on sight in all cities but Cabilis, and level 20% slower than Humans. If you're min-maxing, Iksar is the clear choice, as regeneration is very important for soloing, pulling and living with FD up.

### Starting Statistics

| Race | STR | STA | AGI | DEX | WIS | INT | CHA | Bonus |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Human | 80 | 80 | 85 | 85 | 75 | 75 | 75 | 20 |
| Iksar | 75 | 75 | 100 | 95 | 80 | 75 | 55 | 20 |

*Note: Iksar is only available on servers that have released The Ruins of Kunark expansion.*

### Religion

Monks get little choice of religion. Humans can either be agnostic or follow Quellious. This choice will have only a slight impact on your faction: in general agnostics will be slightly better received in most places, but Quellious followers will better received by the (few) other Quellious worshippers. Both will be welcome in all good cities and killed on sight in evil ones.

Your choice of religion will determine your starting city: agnostic Monks begin in Qeynos, while Monks who follow Quellious will start in Freeport.
