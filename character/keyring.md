  # EQA Server Keys Compendium

As part of the EQA server's **unique ruleset**, keys go to the character's keyring on first use, *regardless of current era*.

However, some keys associated with character progression or intended content restrictions retain their No Drop properties. The intent is to balance quality of life, while ensuring that characters earn the more challenging keys (especially ones associated with quests or boss kills) at least once before it goes to their keyring without bypassing content.

## Nazwadi's Key Compendium

This is a list of keys available in Norrath. They are grouped by expansion, alphabetically by zone name. Underneath all of the expansions is information about common keys that don't have known uses, items or flags that are like keys but work a little differently, and locked doors that have no known keys. Note that Rogues can often avoid the pesky need for keys with their lock-picking skill.

I define keys as actual items that you can put in your inventory and that you click on something to get somewhere that was inaccessible without the item. I do not include flags that do not involve an actual item that serves as the key. Keys that do not look like keys (idols, rings, bracelets, etc.) are still keys. Original information by Verdandi Snowblood from P99, and updated as needed for accuracy on EQA.

## Table Legend

- **Zone:** the zone the key takes you to, which may be just a different part of the zone you were in
- **Key Name:** Exact in-game name of the key
- **Where it Goes:** where the key takes you, and where from if from a different zone
- **Soulbound:** whether the key re-appears in your inventory upon dying
- **Era Tradeable:** can it be traded from one player to another (not NO DROP) in the original historical timeline
- **EQA Tradeable:** can it be traded on EQA server due to the FV-style No Drop ruleset
- **No Rent:** will the item disappear if you log out with it on your character
- **Who Passes:** does it teleport just you, teleport just your group, teleport your raid, or open an actual door so anyone can pass through
- **Other Notes:** including identifying information if there are other items with the same name
