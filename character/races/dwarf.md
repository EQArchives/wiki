Their prominent facial hair is their trademark, seconded by their dexterity.

## Description

Though made lower to the ground than most races, the Dwarves created by Brell Serilis burst with pride and determination. The stout and sturdy Dwarves are extremely strong, making them one of the best-suited to endure long and intense battles

Dwarves have broad faces, usually with a prominent nose, and take extraordinary pride in their hair. Males often take great care to grow long beards and moustaches and females often tie their hair up in a bun. Some females also sport a finely trimmed beard.

### Barrel Roll
Male dwarves have a unique jumping graphic, often referred to as a "barrel roll":

While it is purely cosmetic and offers no in-game benefit, it is a uniquely (male) dwarven behavior. For tips on achieving the "back roll" in this video, see: [How-to: Dwarven Backflip](https://www.project1999.com/forums/showthread.php?t=356850).

### Infravision
Slightly improved night vision, not as good as the [Dark Elf](/character/races/dark-elf)'s Ultravision.
