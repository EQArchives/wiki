# Human
>Humans epitomize the norm in Norrath. 
>\- EverQuest manual

## Description
The strength of the Human race lies in its diversity of thought, belief, and profession; though they tend be weaker than many other races. They have no particular specialty with the sword or arcane magic. While that is true, Humans are cunning and possess great ingenuity, which gives them an advantage. The Human mind is sharp enough to adapt to nearly all forms of study and this gives them a great range of options when choosing a profession.

Humans often divide themselves with their own squabbles, but they will always return to their brother’s side in times of crisis, or to protect a mutual interest.

Humans generally get along well with most good and neutral races, depending on their beliefs and the path of their profession. Humans are not so friendly toward Trolls, Ogres, and other evil races. Dark Elves are tolerated within Freeport, but they tend to be mistrusted, even feared.

The port cities of Qeynos and Freeport lie on opposite coasts of Antonica, and are the most common homes for the Humans. These two cities are the center of Human activity, although this race can be found wandering on virtually every continent of Norrath and beyond.

>Note: In classic-era game clients, night blindness was a real problem with humans; especially when not carrying a light source. The Everquest Trilogy client is probably the last version of the client where this was still implemented.
