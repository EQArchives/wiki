# Vah Shir (VAH)

## Description
The Vah Shir are a regal feline race that walk upright. They were once the ruling class of other similar cat-like races on Odus. Since being translocated onto the moon called Luclin by a collision of Erudite magic, they learned to survive and became stronger. Vah Shir are as tall as Barbarians and display a variety of different markings on their fur based on their lineage. Despite of their height, they are very agile and graceful. They are known for their integrity and the destructive feral power they bring down on their enemies.

Vah Shir follow no particular religion, but they do pay homage to their king, Raja Kerrath. Because of the adversity they have faced, the Vah Shir share a tight bond with one another and are extremely loyal to kin. The Vah Shir are selfless and focus on the good of all rather than their individual needs.

Because the Vah Shir are not exposed to the daily struggles in Norrath, they are indifferent to the various races of Norrath.

Shar Vahl is the majestic den of the Vah Shir. The city was built high above Norrath, on the moon Luclin. The city is located between the Hollowshade Moor and Shadeweaver's Thicket.
