# Froglok
>Frogloks will not become a playable race until the Legacy of Ykesha expansion, and require game clients that support LoY.
{.is-warning}
## Description
The Frogloks are a breed apart from their unawoken brethren that still roam the wild lands of Norrath to this day. Blessed by Mithaniel Marr and awoken to do his will, the majority of Frogloks are a noble race, though a minority of the once-chosen have been corrupted by Innoruuk's hateful touch and have turned to his interests. The Frogloks have a strong hatred for the Trolls; they managed to successfully besiege and take their swamp town of Grobb for their own, renaming it Gukta - they have however since lost control of the town to the Trolls again and have been forced to relocate to a ramshackle tent city in the Rathe Mountains.

The Frogloks are fairly adaptable as a race and as such are capable of pursuing several professions - they are capable spellcasters, able to become Necromancers and Wizards. They are also able to devote themselves to their divine deity, serving them through prayer as a Cleric or Shaman or through active service as a Paladin or Shadowknight. Finally, they are particularly adept at melee battle due to their agile and dexterous nature, and as such are capable Warriors and Rogues.

Being swamp-dwelling creatures, the Frogloks are particularly resistant to poisons. Thanks to their blessing by Mithaniel Marr they also boast an innate resistance to magic. Living life in the swamplands has also made them naturally capable swimmers.

>During the events of The War in 2005, the trolls reclaimed Grobb with the assistance of the Teir'Dal. Gukta was relocated to the Rathe Mountains. The Frogloks, distraught at their loss, took to darker magics and deception to assist in gaining their old home back. Frogloks can now, in addition to the aforementioned classes, play as necromancers, rogues, and shadow knights[^1][^2]. In 2014, Monks became a playable class for Frogloks.[^3]
