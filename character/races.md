A world in many ways similar to our own, Norrath teems with an amount of life far greater than ours. The sheer number of races is mind boggling, from the imposing Ice Giants of the far North to the Lizard Men of the Oggok swamps to the feline Kerran warriors. Each of the myriad races has a unique role to play in the society and culture of Norrathian existence, but only twelve of the most important are available to be played by you.

These twelve represent the special races chosen, favored and created by the various deities and demigods that squabble over Norrath. Each race is unique, composed of varying abilities. motivations and physical make-up.

From the barbarians of the frozen north to the trolls in the southern swamps, the lands of Norrath are full of many different races, each with their own civilizations, cultures, and tolerances. Each race has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well, ranging from physical and mental abilities, class choices, and special abilities (or lack thereof). Very little will affect your character as much as your choice of race, which, once decided, you can't change during the course of your character's career.

At initial launch, EverQuest had 12 playable races.

## Racial Innates

### Barrel Roll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFXUYl2ljqI

Male Dwarves have a unique jumping graphic; it is purely cosmetic (no in-game benefit).

### Frontal Stun Immunity
Ogres cannot be stunned from the front, which gives them a great advantage over other races.
* Enemy attacks can still push you backwards, which will interrupt your spell casting.
* Tip: You can stand in a corner to avoid being pushed back.

### Forage
This ability allows a character to gather food and other items from the ground. Wood Elves and Iksar have the natural ability to forage for food.

### Hide
Halflings, Dark Elves, and Wood Elves have the innate ability to vanish from sight. This ability is similar to an Invisibility spell except that it can fail, and unless done while sneaking, it will fail once a character moves again.

### Increased Armor Class
Iksar start with a +15 AC bonus (+17 if they are a Warrior) over other races, which scales with level, increasing up to a maximum of +35. However, they cannot wear most pre-Velious plate armor.

### Increased Consumption Rate
Barbarians, Halflings, Ogres, and Trolls all consume food and drink slightly faster than other races.

### Increased HP Regeneration
Both Iksar and Trolls have higher HP regeneration rates (per tick):

* Level 01-19: 4 sitting, 2 feigned, 2 standing
* Level 20-49: 6 sitting, 2 feigned, 2 standing
* Level 50: 8 sitting, 2 feigned, 2 standing
* Level 51-55: 12 sitting, 8 feigned, 6 standing
* Level 56-59: 16 sitting, 12 feigned, 10 standing
* Level 60: 18 sitting, 14 feigned, 12 standing

Comparatively, these are the HP regeneration rates (per tick) for all other races:

* Level 01-19: 2 sitting, 1 feigned, 1 standing
* Level 20-49: 3 sitting, 1 feigned, 1 standing
* Level 50: 4 sitting, 1 feigned, 1 standing
* Level 51-55: 5 sitting, 3 feigned, 2 standing
* Level 56-59: 6 sitting, 4 feigned, 3 standing
* Level 60: 7 sitting, 5 feigned, 4 standing

A "tick" happens every 6 seconds (server side).

* It does not matter whether you are sitting or standing between seconds 1 and 5, only the 6th second.

### Infravision
Slightly improved night vision, but not as good as the Dark Elf's Ultravision. Has a slightly reddish tint.

### Sense Heading
This skill allows a player to get a sense of what direction they are currently heading. All player characters can train this skill at their guildmaster, however Dwarves start with a skill of 50.

### Slam
This racial ability allows the large races to effectively bash without a shield. This can interrupt spell-casting. Available to Barbarians, Ogres, and Trolls.

### Sneak
This skill is normally only available to the Rogue class, however all Halflings have an innate talent for this. When combined with the Hide skill, it allows one to move while effectively invisible.

### Swimming
While this skill is available to all races, Iksar in particular start out at 100 skill. The higher the skill in swimming, the faster one can move in water.

### Tinkering
This racial ability is a tradeskill only available to Gnomes and allows them to create specialty gadgets.

### Ultravision
*See also: Ultravision (Spell)*
Extremely improved night vision, better than Infravision. Ultravision has a slightly purple tint to it.
