 # Races

A world in many ways similar to our own, Norrath teems with an amount of life far greater than ours. The sheer number of races is mind boggling, from the imposing Ice Giants of the far North to the Lizard Men of the Oggok swamps to the feline Kerran warriors. Each of the myriad races has a unique role to play in the society and culture of Norrathian existence, but only twelve of the most important are available to be played by you.

These twelve represent the special races chosen, favored and created by the various deities and demigods that squabble over Norrath. Each race is unique, composed of varying abilities. motivations and physical make-up.

From the barbarians of the frozen north to the trolls in the southern swamps, the lands of Norrath are full of many different races, each with their own civilizations, cultures, and tolerances. Each race has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well, ranging from physical and mental abilities, class choices, and special abilities (or lack thereof). Very little will affect your character as much as your choice of race, which, once decided, you can't change during the course of your character's career.

## PLAYABLE Races

At initial launch, there were 12 playable races. This increased to 13 when Kunark launched, and 14 when Luclin launched.  Each playable race has a number of Classes from which they can choose.

### [Barbarian](/character/races/barbarian) (BAR)

* **Armor**: Large and Medium, *Cannot Wear Robes*
* **Experience Modifier**: 5% More Required per Level
* **Faction Alignment**: Good
* **Playable Classes**: Rogue, Shaman, Warrior
* **Racial(s)**: Increased Consumption Rate, Slam, +10 Cold Resist
* **Starting City**: Halas

The hardy race of Barbarians, or Northmen, use their wisdom and formidable brawn to defend honor and justice. Their magnificent stature is a sight to behold; even more so when it is unleashed in battle. Barbarians are one of the tallest races to walk the lands of Norrath.

As a tribal culture, Barbarians are a little rough around the edges when it comes to interactions with other races. Even the Barbarians' mannerisms and features have a rugged quality.

The Barbarians consider themselves superior to other inhabitants of Norrath, particularly the Teir'Dal and Erudites, which are viewed as pathetically weak. Barbarians have a special place in their hearts for the Dwarves of Kaladim whom they view as steadfast and brave. The high quality of Dwarven mead may also have some influence on the cordial relationship between the two races. Ogres, Trolls, Dark Elves, and the other evil races are hated, as they directly oppose the Barbarians' sense of justice.

Barbarians live in the frigid city of Halas, nestled amidst the icy peaks of Everfrost in Northern Antonica. The city is rather rudimentary, but serves the needs of the Barbarians that call it home.

*Note: In classic-era game clients, night blindness was a real problem with Barbarians; especially when not carrying a light source. The Everquest Trilogy client is probably the last version of the client where this was still implemented.*

### [Dark Elf](/character/races/dark-elf) (DEF)

* **Armor**: Medium and Small
* **Experience Modifier**: None
* **Faction Alignment**: Evil
* **Playable Classes**: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Rogue, Shadow Knight, Warrior, Wizard
* **Racial(s)**: Hide, Ultravision
* **Starting City**: Neriak

The Teir'Dal, or Dark Elves, are a twisted reflection of the Elves of light, but are just as lithe and intelligent as their cousins. Their features are often soft and delicate, though the eyes of the Dark Elves betray their darker inclinations. The Dark Elves' skin ranges from blue tones to black and their hair is most often white with some variances. They reach a height of about five feet tall.

Innoruuk, Lord of Hate, created the Teir'Dal and his hatred flows through their veins and moves their black hearts. It runs so deep that the Teir'Dal hate all, including their own kind and their creator.

The Dark Elves view all other races as inferior; tools to be used for their own evil manipulations. Most races fear the Dark Elves. The Teir'Dal would desire the fall of the rest of the Elven world, leaving them broken, eradicated, or enslaved. Though viewed as inferior and dimwitted, Trolls and Ogres are tolerated as they are useful in the Teir'Dal plans for conquest.

There is a labyrinth of evil under the Nektulos Forest called Neriak, the home city of the Dark Elves. Its entrance is deep within gloomy shadows of the woods.

### Dwarf (DWF)

* **Armor**: Small, *Cannot Wear Robes*
* **Experience Modifier**: None
* **Faction Alignment**: Good
* **Playable Classes**: Cleric, Paladin, Rogue, Warrior
* **Racial(s)**: Barrel Roll, Infravision, Sense Heading (+50), +5 Magic Resist, +5 Poison Resist
* **Starting City**: Kaladim

Though made lower to the ground than most races, the Dwarves created by Brell Serilis burst with pride and determination. The stout and sturdy Dwarves are extremely strong, making them one of the best-suited to endure long and intense battles

Dwarves have broad faces, usually with a prominent nose, and take extraordinary pride in their hair. Males often take great care to grow long beards and moustaches and females often tie their hair up in a bun. Some females also sport a finely trimmed beard.

### Erudite (ERU)

* **Armor**: Medium
* **Experience Modifier**: None
* **Faction Alignment**: Neutral
* **Playable Classes**: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Paladin, Shadow Knight, Wizard
* **Racial(s)**: -5 Disease Resist, +5 Magic Resist
* **Starting City**: Erudin, Paineel

The Erudites trace their ancestry back to the great mage, Erud, who led them to Odus. They are descendents of the original humans on Norrath and inherited the best of human intelligence. Their extraordinary acumen came at the price of thinner, more delicate bodies. Erudites reach about six feet tall, with some of that height attributed to their high foreheads.

Unique accomplishments with magic and study have understandably led the Erudites to believe that they are the most intellectually superior race on Norrath. They are known for their serious demeanor.

Most Erudites spend their days absorbed in books and tomes, or magical contemplation, and they typically do not involve themselves in matters that do not directly affect them. They often pay no regard to anyone that hasn't achieved intellectual accomplishment. That in mind, Erudites do not associate with the evil races. Even the Erudite Heretics of Paineel are not fond of Dark Elves, Ogres and Trolls.

The Erudites live in two areas on the continent of Odus near the Toxxulia Forest. One city, housing the purer of heart, is called Erudin - an ornate city gleaming with polished marble and babbling fountains. Paineel is the home of the rebellious Erudite Heretics who were banished from the city for delving into the forbidden realm of dark magic.

*Note: In classic-era game clients, night blindness was a real problem with Erudites; especially when not carrying a light source. The Everquest Trilogy client is probably the last version of the client where this was still implemented.*

### Gnome (GNM)

* **Armor**: Small
* **Experience Modifier**: None
* **Faction Alignment**: Neutral
* **Playable Classes**: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Paladin*, Rogue, Shadow Knight* Wizard
* **Racial(s)**: Tinkering, Infravision
* **Starting City**: Ak'Anon

While Gnomes are knee-high to some of the taller races, they make up for it with their cleverness and skills. They are by no means a strong and sturdy race, but their edge is their dexterity and intelligence. They were the second race, after Dwarves, created by Brell Serilis.

Gnomes have an innate preoccupation and skill with gadgets. They are a curious race that creates strange, but very useful items that enhance their lives. Gnomes have created a number of fantastic machines, including an observatory which houses one of the most powerful telescopes in Norrath. Even with all of their accomplishments, gnomes are rarely taken seriously because of their size and behavior.

Gnomes are friendly with all good Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, and Humans. Although they do not quite understand the Erudites, they will interact with them. Gnomes have a general aversion to Trolls, Ogres, Teir'Dal, and other evil races, but don't necessarily hate them.

The clicking of gears and clacking of machinery fill the mechanized Gnome city of Ak'Anon that lies southeast of the Faydark, on the continent of Faydwer.

*Note: In the original timeline, Gnome Paladin and Gnome Shadowknight combinations were first implemented on March 19, 2002 (4 months after Shadows of Luclin which launched December 2001).*

### Half-Elf (HEF)

* **Armor**: Medium, *Cannot Wear Robes*
* **Experience Modifier**: None
* **Faction Alignment**: Neutral
* **Playable Classes**: Bard, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior
* **Racial(s)**: Infravision
* **Starting City**: Freeport, Kelethin, Surefall Glade, Qeynos

The mixing of Elf and Human is a common tale. Many stories of romance between these two races can be heard around Norrath. As a result, Half Elves are taller than their Elven ancestors and carry some of the strength of their human bloodlines. They have slightly harsher features than Elves, but the mix still makes them pleasant to lay eyes on.

Unfortunately, the children of these forbidden romances are often shunned, becoming victims of prejudice by Humans and Elves alike. Most Half Elves are unaffected by the discrimination and retain a pleasant manner. Usually Half Elves will develop a very close and trusted group of friends that act as a surrogate family.

The difficult lives of the Half Elves and their lack of ties to any one place makes them adept travelers of the world and exceptional friends and storytellers. Sadly, some Half Elves become embittered by the constant difficulty of finding a place in the world and choose a path of thievery. The Half Elves are on amicable terms with most races in Norrath, but have no affection for the evil races.

While Half Elves can be seen in many areas of the world, they are primarily found in the Wood Elf city of Kelethin and within the Surefall Glade.

### Halfling (HFL)

* **Armor**: Small, *Cannot Wear Robes*
* **Experience Modifier**: 5% less experience required per level
* **Faction Alignment**: Good
* **Playable Classes**: Cleric, Druid, Paladin*, Ranger*, Rogue, Warrior
* **Racial(s)**: Hide (+50), Increased Consumption Rate, Infravision, Sneak (+50), +5 Disease Resist, +5 Poison Resist
* **Starting City**: Rivervale

Halflings are aptly named, as they are half the size of the average height for most of Norrath's races. They usually measure about three feet in height and are often thick around their middles. Their lack of height is not be confused as a weakness though; if confronted or threatened, Halflings are very capable.

Halflings are happy-go-lucky and hospitable. Any one of them would readily give their life for a friend. They are renowned for their tomfoolery and humor, always appreciating a bit of fun. They especially like to tease Erudites for their lack of wit. Enjoying what each day brings is a large part of their lives.

Halflings tend to get along well with most races, except those that are truly evil, but even then rare friendships are made with members of the less savory races.

The quaint, stunted city of Rivervale lies between the Kithicor Forest and Misty Thicket in central Antonica. It is crowded with skilled tradesman, taverns, and friendly folk.

*Note: In the original timeline, Halfling Paladin and Halfling Ranger combinations were first implemented on March 19, 2002 (4 months after Shadows of Luclin which launched December 2001).*

### High Elf (HIE)

* **Armor**: Medium, Small
* **Experience Modifier**: None
* **Faction Alignment**: Good
* **Playable Classes**: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Paladin, Wizard
* **Racial(s)**: Infravision
* **Starting City**: Felwithe

The High Elves, also known as the Koada'Dal, are regarded as the closest relatives of the original Norrathian Elves created by Tunare, Mother of All. These noble creatures stand tall with ivory skin and gentle features. They are certainly not the sturdiest of races, but make up for that with heart. Throughout the ages, they have stood for freedom and justice, fighting evil with powerful magic and their skills with the blade.

The High Elves are known for their civilized conduct and, as such, are perceived as a race rather full of their own importance, though they are quite benevolent. They expect to be treated with respect and do have a haughty pride about them. As a result, it is difficult to make friends with a High Elf.

The High Elves feel their cousins, the Wood Elves, are to be sought out as loyal servants. This noble race views Humans, Gnomes, and Halflings as worthy of their presence. Dwarves, Barbarians, and Erudites, however, are simply endured. The High Elves expend little effort to help them. The evil races are looked upon with contempt and will be dispatched when opportunity presents itself.

The home of the High Elves is within the magnificent and pristine architecture of the city of Felwithe. The structures crafted behind the walls make the beauty of the surrounding forests pale. The city lies within the Greater Faydark on the continent of Faydwer.

### Human (HUM)

* **Armor**: Medium
* **Experience Modifier**: None
* **Faction Alignment**: Neutral
* **Playable Classes**: Bard, Cleric, Druid, Enchanter, Magician, Monk, Necromancer, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Shadow Knight, Warrior, Wizard
* **Racial(s)**: None*
* **Starting City**: Freeport, Qeynos

The strength of the Human race lies in its diversity of thought, belief, and profession; though they tend be weaker than many other races. They have no particular specialty with the sword or arcane magic. While that is true, Humans are cunning and possess great ingenuity, which gives them an advantage. The Human mind is sharp enough to adapt to nearly all forms of study and this gives them a great range of options when choosing a profession.

Humans often divide themselves with their own squabbles, but they will always return to their brother's side in times of crisis, or to protect a mutual interest.

Humans generally get along well with most good and neutral races, depending on their beliefs and the path of their profession. Humans are not so friendly toward Trolls, Ogres, and other evil races. Dark Elves are tolerated within Freeport, but they tend to be mistrusted, even feared.

The port cities of Qeynos and Freeport lie on opposite coasts of Antonica, and are the most common homes for the Humans. These two cities are the center of Human activity, although this race can be found wandering on virtually every continent of Norrath and beyond.

*Note: In classic-era game clients, night blindness was a real problem with humans; especially when not carrying a light source. The Everquest Trilogy client is probably the last version of the client where this was still implemented.*

### [Iksar](/character/races/iksar) (IKS)

* **Armor**: Medium, **Cannot Wear Plate**
* **Experience Modifier**: 20% More Required per Level
* **Faction Alignment**: Evil ("super evil", not friendly with the other evil races of Antonica)
* **Playable Classes**: Monk, Necromancer, Shadow Knight, Shaman, Warrior
* **Racial(s)**: Forage, Increased Armor Class, Increased HP Regeneration, Infravision, Swimming (100), -10 Cold Resist, +5 Fire Resist
* **Starting City**: Cabilis

The fearsome and savage reptilian race on Norrath is known as the Iksar. With their significant height, scales, and long tails, Iksar are intimidating in their appearance. Their reptilian physiology grants them a natural affinity for water, as well as enhanced regeneration.

Their entire civilization developed in isolation for centuries and fostered an unusual culture. The Iksar are a tribal race with a very simple social structure. Allies to no one, the Iksar are intelligent and proud. Having seen their race crumble through the toils of war, the race has become bitter about its loss of power. After being slaves and warring with the Ring of Scale, they were nearly made extinct.

The Iksar depend only on their god and creator, Cazic Thule. Iksar are unwelcome in all known cities of Norrath except Thurgadin. Iksar are no more fond of the other races of Norrath than those races are fond of them.

The Iksar live in the ancient city of Cabilis, on Kunark near the Lake of Ill Omen. It is a dark place with a maze of canals, which the Iksar use for travel around their city.

### Ogre (OGR)

* **Armor**: Large, *Cannot Wear Robes*
* **Experience Modifier**: 15% more experience required per level
* **Faction Alignment**: Evil
* **Playable Classes**: Beastlord*, Shadow Knight, Shaman, Warrior
* **Racial(s)**: Increased Consumption Rate, Infravision, Frontal Stun Immunity, Slam
* **Starting City**: Oggok

With their lumbering gait and enormous breadth, Ogres are an ominous presence. Created by Rallos Zek, these massive creatures are feared in battle for their raw strength and uncanny endurance. While not very intelligent, Ogres are known to cooperate with one another quite efficiently.

The Ogres have a twisted sense of duty that could easily be mistaken for stupidity. They are, justifiably, quite single-minded. Their thick skulls also give them a high level of resistance to being stunned in battle.

Ogres have been known to be cannibalistic, but are more partial to eating Humans, Erudites, and High Elves. Nearly all of the good and neutral races avoid them out of self-preservation. Ogres have learned to work with the Trolls, but have no love for them, and they fear Dark Elves.

The crude tunneled city of Oggok lies within the Feerrott, a jungle-like area bordering the Innothule Swamp and Rathe Mountains in southern Antonica. The home city for the Ogres is a fairly slow-paced civilization that focuses on battle training and magic to give them an upper hand in battle.

### Troll (TRL)

* **Armor**: Large, *Cannot Wear Robes*
* **Experience Modifier**: 20% more experience required per level
* **Faction Alignment**: Evil
* **Playable Classes**: Shadow Knight, Shaman, Warrior
* **Racial(s)**: Increased Consumption Rate, Increased HP Regeneration, Infravision, Slam, -20 Fire Resist
* **Starting City**: Grobb

Trolls are often considered a hideous and deplorable race that carries a sickening smell. This view suits the Trolls, as they are generally unpleasant to everyone. Trolls are an immense race, at least twice as strong as the average human. They have the ability to regenerate faster than most other races. Trolls have two primary motivators: food and power. These grotesque creatures will eat just about anything.

Trolls are extremely cruel and their greed is almost insatiable. They trust no one, not even each other. Trolls also fancy that they have advanced abilities in the culinary arts, with their ability to pickle just about anything, or make a meal out of "spare parts."

Trolls generally detest the other races, including other Trolls. They tend to put up with the Dark Elves out of fear, much like Ogres do.

The city of Grobb lies within the Innothule Swamp of Antonica. The city is infested with mosquitoes and spiders, which serve as both pets and snacks for the Trolls.

### Wood Elf (ELF)

* **Armor**: Medium, Small, *Cannot Wear Robes*
* **Experience Modifier**: None
* **Faction Alignment**: Good
* **Playable Classes**: Bard, Druid, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior
* **Racial(s)**: Forage, Hide, Infravision
* **Starting City**: Kelethin

The Wood Elves, or Feir'Dal, are more accepting of others than their cousins, the High Elves. Like their pale cousins, Wood Elves only reach about five feet in height and have very attractive and subtle features. They skins are tinged an oaken color and they blend with their natural surroundings in the forests.

Wood Elves generally regard those who respect nature as friends, especially rangers and druids. The Wood Elves believe in co-existing with their natural surroundings as opposed to shaping them. This leads most of their kind to worship Tunare, the Mother of All. The Feir'Dal harness the powers of song and the living, breathing properties of their environment. Wood Elves are known for their love of celebration and good food. A good song will tweak their pointed ears.

Wood Elves get along well with most good and neutral races, and merely dislike most evil races. They hold great malice toward the Dark Elves - an aberration of their ancestors as well as their allies.

The Feir'Dal are at home in the trees in their intricate city of Kelethin, which hangs high above the ground between the trunks and branches of the Greater Faydark. Comprised of platforms and suspension bridges, Kelethin is both well defended and beautiful.

### Vah Shir (VAH)
* **Armor**: Large
* **Experience Modifier**: None
* **Faction Alignment**: Neutral
* **Playable Classes**: Bard, Beastlord, Berserker, Rogue, Shaman, Warrior
* **Racial(s)**: Safe Fall, Infravision
* **Starting City**: Shar Vhal

 The Vah Shir are a sentient, bipedal cat race hailing from the city of Shar Vahl. Their racial name pays tribute to two kings, Vah and Shir. The Vah Shir evolved from the Kerrans who survived an accidental magical blast which sent them to Luclin from Odus during the Erudite civil war. Due to their size, they are required to wear large armor. They are the only large race that cannot slam. However, they do receive the racial ability of Safe Fall.

The Vah Shir have a strong oral tradition, and generally do not keep written records aside from dealing with outside races. An oral tradition leads many of them to take up the skills of a bard, passing their knowledge and history through music and prose.

Their oral traditions, coupled with their agnostic religious beliefs, hinder their ability to study the arcane. However, much like the Feir'Dal have a strong affinity to nature, the Vah Shir have a strong connection to the spirit world. Those wishing to study the priestly arts may opt to become shamen.

Many Vah Shir feel attuned to their animalistic instincts. While they have some ability in magic, many wish to be at the forefront of action. These fighting, magical casters later evolve into beastlords.

Their natural stealth and racially innate Safe Fall ability allow them to rank amoungst the best rogues. Their warriors seek to preserve their way of life through a level of honor equivilant to that of Barbarians and dwarves, and garnish much respect from their society.

As the Vah Shir have been separated from Norrath since before the split of the Combine Empire, they do not entertain any of the racial or religious tensions that most of Norrath's citizens harbor. While they are unable to receive training, evil races and classes may walk around without fear of an unprovoked attack. However, druids and rangers may find themselves quickly under siege should they employ the wolf form of speed-enhancing run spells.

The ancestors of the Vah Shir race arrived on Luclin some time after the Shissar race with a small working knowledge of the Erudian language. As the Combine Empire split and its factions came to reside on Luclin, they interacted and traded with the Vah Shir. This interaction helped the Vah Shir in quickly learning the Combine Tongue language. They also employ their own racial langage when dealing with each other.

## Racial Innates

### Barrel Roll
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFXUYl2ljqI

Male Dwarves have a unique jumping graphic; it is purely cosmetic (no in-game benefit).

### Frontal Stun Immunity
Ogres cannot be stunned from the front, which gives them a great advantage over other races.
* Enemy attacks can still push you backwards, which will interrupt your spell casting.
* Tip: You can stand in a corner to avoid being pushed back.

### Forage
This ability allows a character to gather food and other items from the ground. Wood Elves and Iksar have the natural ability to forage for food.

### Hide
Halflings, Dark Elves, and Wood Elves have the innate ability to vanish from sight. This ability is similar to an Invisibility spell except that it can fail, and unless done while sneaking, it will fail once a character moves again.

### Increased Armor Class
Iksar start with a +15 AC bonus (+17 if they are a Warrior) over other races, which scales with level, increasing up to a maximum of +35. However, they cannot wear most pre-Velious plate armor.

### Increased Consumption Rate
Barbarians, Halflings, Ogres, and Trolls all consume food and drink slightly faster than other races.

### Increased HP Regeneration
Both Iksar and Trolls have higher HP regeneration rates (per tick):

* Level 01-19: 4 sitting, 2 feigned, 2 standing
* Level 20-49: 6 sitting, 2 feigned, 2 standing
* Level 50: 8 sitting, 2 feigned, 2 standing
* Level 51-55: 12 sitting, 8 feigned, 6 standing
* Level 56-59: 16 sitting, 12 feigned, 10 standing
* Level 60: 18 sitting, 14 feigned, 12 standing

Comparatively, these are the HP regeneration rates (per tick) for all other races:

* Level 01-19: 2 sitting, 1 feigned, 1 standing
* Level 20-49: 3 sitting, 1 feigned, 1 standing
* Level 50: 4 sitting, 1 feigned, 1 standing
* Level 51-55: 5 sitting, 3 feigned, 2 standing
* Level 56-59: 6 sitting, 4 feigned, 3 standing
* Level 60: 7 sitting, 5 feigned, 4 standing

A "tick" happens every 6 seconds (server side).

* It does not matter whether you are sitting or standing between seconds 1 and 5, only the 6th second.

### Infravision
Slightly improved night vision, but not as good as the Dark Elf's Ultravision. Has a slightly reddish tint.

### Sense Heading
This skill allows a player to get a sense of what direction they are currently heading. All player characters can train this skill at their guildmaster, however Dwarves start with a skill of 50.

### Slam
This racial ability allows the large races to effectively bash without a shield. This can interrupt spell-casting. Available to Barbarians, Ogres, and Trolls.

### Sneak
This skill is normally only available to the Rogue class, however all Halflings have an innate talent for this. When combined with the Hide skill, it allows one to move while effectively invisible.

### Swimming
While this skill is available to all races, Iksar in particular start out at 100 skill. The higher the skill in swimming, the faster one can move in water.

### Tinkering
This racial ability is a tradeskill only available to Gnomes and allows them to create specialty gadgets.

### Ultravision
*See also: Ultravision (Spell)*
Extremely improved night vision, better than Infravision. Ultravision has a slightly purple tint to it.
