| **Everquest: Titanium Edition** | January 10, 2006 | This is the client used by Project 1999. EQEMU: "This client was the start of the disk-standard whereby the play servers accept client versions that were released on DVD instead of the previously chaotic method of attempting to keep up with every patched version of Everquest. It is widely accepted that this standard greatly increased the popularity of EQ emulation as a client could be easily obtained, and the long term stability of the client allowed the developers to focus on other issues." |
| Prophecy of Ro | February 2006 | |
| The Serpent's Spine | September 2006 | |
| The Buried Sea | February 2007 | |
| **Everquest: Anniversary Edition** | March 16, 2007 | EverQuest The Anniversary Edition is a compilation of the first eight years of content. |
| Secrets of Faydwer | November 2007 | EQEMU: "This client was chosen as a more modern standard to Titanium, and as the most contemporary version released on DVD. The client proved to be unstable at times and was not widely accepted." |
| Seeds of Destruction | October 2008 | EQEMU: "Seeds of Destruction - While released exclusively as a downloaded product it has proven to have all of the modern benefits as Secrets of Faydwer while being far more stable. It is quickly becoming the standard, though according to a poll on Peqtgc.com, Titanium is still the most commonly used client. This client is no longer available for download. Purchasing and downloading this client will actually yield a version of Underfoot." |
| Underfoot | December 2009 | |
| Underfoot STEAM | June 8, 2010 | EQEMU: "This version can be downloaded only from steam. Purchasing and downloading Underfoot or Seeds of Destruction will both give you access to only this version. The only difference between the two products is the price, and what expansions the product key activates." |
| House of Thule | October 2010 | |
| Veil of Alaris | November 2011 | |
| Rain of Fear | November 2012 | Wikipedia: "Followed by the major content patches Shadow of Fear in April 2013 and Heart of Fear in July 2013." |
| Call of the Forsaken | October 2013 | Wikipedia: "Followed by the major content patches Hate Rising in January 2014." |
