## Server Ruleset

* Progression server initially based on TAKP fork of EQEMU Server
    * When the server is ready to progress beyond PoP, we will upgrade clients and migrate to the EQEMU Server source.  *If there is a desire to maintain the classic server once this happens, that option is on the table.*
* New expansions will be released 3 months after all raid targets in the current expansion have been defeated
* World configuration (rules, quests, spawn rates, drop rates) will attempt era accuracy unless otherwise noted
* Server is currently in the **Shadows of Luclin** expansion
    * Planes of Power release date is still TBD
* Firiona Vie (FV)-style loot rules: most items are tradeable!
* **3-box limit**
    * This is enforced by IP and GM logs.
* Player vs Environment (PVE)
* Permanent group experience bonus as described in the ⁠[FAQ](/getting-started/faq)

### Custom Changes to from EQ Era

* /ooc and /auction are server-wide
* Class and Race-based exp penalties have been removed in favor of [the January 14, 2001 (Velious Era) producer's letter](/lore/producers_letter_20010114) changes described by Gordon Wrinn
* [Miragul's Highway](/world/miraguls-highway) is implemented
* [Legacy items](/world/legacy-items) will remain in game permanently at adjusted rarity
* [Keyrings](/character/keyring) are enabled
* LoY-era DoT damage messages (Added in the May 27, 2024 EQA patch)

## Rules of Conduct
### 1. Automation and other AFK Shenanigans

The only activities permitted while AFK is: sitting/standing and doing nothing, raising casting skills and bard songs, skilling up forage, AFK swimming, archery/ranged skillups; all in non-populated areas. Gaining experience while AFK using a pet or any other non-human mechanism or form of automation is strictly prohibited.  This does not mean you can't go AFK while your group members continue to kill mobs.  This applies to situations where no human is present or responsive at a camp/location but experience is still being gained.  All else not explicitly mentioned previously is up to the GM (but will not be a bannable offense on first warning).  Be responsible, respect others, and don't be a nuisance.

### 2. Macros and 3rd Party Programs

The only approved use of third-party macros, scripts, or other forms of automation are those explicitly permitted by rule 1.  The use of macros for bard twisting, trade skills, quests, and buffing/healing/rezzing/etc. are strictly prohibited.   If you can't physically manage multiple accounts without the assistance of extra programs or macros, you should not box. We are a community server, this is intended to create and keep the game play as such. No exceptions.  Programs to simplify login, limit FPS are permitted, and simply switch windows between toons (Hotkeynet) are permitted.  Any program that functions by simply parsing log files is fine.

### 3. Approved Clients & Mods

1. The 2002-era "TAKP client" (Windows, Linux, or MacOS variant) is the only permitted client for this server.  
    * *When the server progresses beyond PoP, we will update this rule accordingly.*
2. Zeal is an authorized mod currently found at https://github.com/CoastalRedwood/Zeal/
3. By exception, client mods posted in Discord in the #⁠server-files channel to provide QoL like camera zoom with mouse scroll wheel are permitted.  
    * Contact a GM if you have any questions - if not responding in game, DM via Discord.  We will post any future approved mods in ⁠server-files if approved.
