## Overview
In terms of the game, The Ruins of Kunark had a very different visual feel compared to the original zones in EverQuest: the color palette was more vibrant and many of the models used for the monsters were more detailed. This detail was most evident in the Iksar, a new playable race of lizard people introduced with the expansion. The Iksar had a number of racial advantages, including the ability to stay underwater for longer periods of time, additional regenerative powers, and an armor bonus. This was balanced by the fact that they were hated by all of the other races in the game and that there were very few places they could go without being attacked. They also could not wear plate armor.

The Kunark expansion also increased the maximum level a character could attain from 50 to 60, and introduced a substantial number of new and powerful monsters for characters above level 50 to fight. The most notable of these was Veeshan's Peak, a zone populated by dragons that was, at its release, declared to be the hardest zone that would be put into EverQuest. In reality, the zone quickly was surpassed by other zones released in further expansions, and is in fact not used often by players.

Another notable and deep dungeon is Sebilis, the lair of the undead dragon Trakanon, which required players to level past the previous limit and obtain improved gear introduced in the expansion.

The Ruins of Kunark was also the focus of 'epic quests', or quests for powerful weapons for each character class, which were introduced between the Kunark and Velious expansions as a source of further high-end content.

The Kunark expansion was unique in its method of distribution. A player would order the expansion from Verant's online store, and it was then shipped directly to the player's home. Unforeseen shipping delays caused many players to miss the expansion's official opening date. Thereafter, most EverQuest expansions were either available in local stores, or downloaded directly from Verant, many weeks before the official opening date.

## Progression

### Leveling Path
 The leveling path will remain roughly the same with a few deviations
 
- 1-10: Newbie Zone
- 10-20:[Estate of Unrest](https://www.eqarchives.com/zones/view/unrest){:target="_blank"} / [Kurn's Tower](https://www.eqarchives.com/zones/view/kurn){:target="_blank"} (Kunark Zone)
- 20-30: [Estate of Unrest](https://www.eqarchives.com/zones/view/unrest){:target="_blank"} / [Upper Guk](https://www.eqarchives.com/zones/view/guktop){:target="_blank"}
- 30-40: [Lower Guk](https://www.eqarchives.com/zones/view/gukbottom){:target="_blank"}
- 35-45: [City Of Mist](https://www.eqarchives.com/zones/view/citymist){:target="_blank"} (Kunark Zone) This zone was heavily nerfed and not what it once was but it is something different at least.
- 40-50: [The Hole](https://www.eqarchives.com/zones/view/hole){:target="_blank"} / [Ocean of Tears](https://www.eqarchives.com/zones/view/oot){:target="_blank"} Elite Goblin Island
- 45-60: [Sebilis](https://www.eqarchives.com/zones/view/sebilis){:target="_blank"} (Kunark Zone) Great from 45-55 but slows down after. Loot is arguably better than Chardok in some camps.
- 50-60: [Chardok](https://www.eqarchives.com/zones/view/chardok){:target="_blank"} (Kunark Zone) Best xp from 50-60 hands down

The end raid zone of the expansion packed with dragons and loot but you must engage the mighty Phara Dar to escape alive!

 ### Major Items

There are frankly far too many items to go over in depth but we'll cover a couple of the more legendary items as well as those that are only temporarily available. Each non INT caster class also has class armor. These are mostly pure AC with various clickies. The BP and legs are the only pieces with stats. They drop from Trakanon and Venril respectively. [EQ Progression](https://www.eqprogression.com/) is a good source for your class clickies.

- Fungus Covered Great Staff - Clicky regen. Only drops during Kunark and very shortly into Velious.
- Circlet of Shadow - Pre-nerf CoS is essential gear for any SK/Necro for a long time. Pre-nerf stops dropping in late Kunark/early Velious
- Fungus Covered Scale Tunic - The legendary regen item worn by twinks the world over.
- Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring - One click is a permanent attack buff but it still provides a trash buff as well.
- Bracer of the Hidden - Instant class see invis. Good trash buff item
- Fingerbone Hoop - Worn see invis
- Worker Sledgemallet - Proccable Overthere port
- Wurmslayer
- Goblin Gazhugi Ring - clickable charm break 

## Major Quests

- Epic Quests - The original versions will be different as many of the "skips" have been removed. Consult Allakhazam particularly for the Rogue & Shaman quests.
- Kunark Spell Hand Ins - Nearly half of the Kunark spells from 51-60 are only obtainable via this quest set. Available in both the Overthere and Firiona Vie.
- Kunark Archaeologist - A set of re-finished quests that were never released originally. Rewards are quite good for the era.
- Bone Chips - The main faction quest used to buff up Iksar faction. It does not affect Necros faction Brood of Kotiz
- Necromancer Skullcap - Nearly required item for necros as it gives a clicky leach dot.
- Shaman Cudgel - Great Shaman item but not to the extent of the Necro skullcap. Gives a strong melee buff similar to primal essence.
- Monk Bracer - Good monk item but no clicky effect so it will be replaced in Velious raiding gear. Mostly used for Whistling Fists in Luclin.
- Warrior Pike - 1h spear 14/24 with DD/stun.
- Greenmist - Shadowknight - Great SK sword -outclassed by Velious raid gear but can be used on Emp Sra in Luclin
- Regal Band of Bathezid - BIS ring item with a rechargable 25 point DS
- Spirit Wracked Cord - Good and versatile item
