# Shadows of Luclin Key Quests & Raid Access Guide

## Key Quests (Raid Access)

> **What are Bane Weapons?** Bane weapons were introduced with Shadows of Luclin and deal special damage to specific enemy types. Emperor Ssraeshza and Lord Inquisitor Seru are immune to regular weapons, making bane weapons **mandatory** for their defeat.
