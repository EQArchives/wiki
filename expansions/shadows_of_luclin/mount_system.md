# Mount System

Mounts were first introduced in the Shadows of Luclin expansion and provide several benefits for travel across Luclin and other outdoor zones.

## Benefits

- **Safe Fall Bonus**: Grants 150 Safe Fall, reducing fall damage[^1]
- **Meditation**: Allows you to meditate while mounted (increases mana regeneration as if sitting)[^1]
- **Combat Ready**: You can cast spells and engage in combat while mounted[^1]
- **Increased Speed**: Varies by bridle type (see Mount Speeds below)

## Limitations

- **Food Consumption**: Mounts consume food at twice the normal rate (feeding both you and the mount)[^1]
- **Illusion Conflicts**: Mounts cannot be used simultaneously with most illusions, though you can maintain buffs from both. Necros can only use Demi Lich. [^1][^9]
- **Indoor Restrictions**: Mounts are unavailable in indoor zones (dungeons, caves, and interior city areas)
- **Zone Restrictions**: Mounts are usable outdoors only[^9]
- **Meditation Effect**: You are treated as sitting/meditating while on a horse, but the meditation effect only works when stationary and not in combat[^9]
- **Luclin Models Required**: You must have Luclin models enabled to ride a horse* [^9]

>There was a known bug on the EQMac client that let you use old models get the horse buff icon, which lets you meditate without riding a horse. The benefit of this is you can move at normal sow speeds while buying the cheapest horse, don't suffer from acceleration/deceleration effect of horses, can duck spells to interrupt casting, and not have to use Luclin models if you don't like the graphic.[^9]

## Mount Acquisition

Mounts are summoned and controlled using **Bridles**. Different bridle types produce different mount appearances and speeds.

### Bridle Coloring and Pricing

Bridles come in four colors: **Black, White, Brown, and Tan**. Color affects pricing but not functionality.

- **Black and White**: More expensive and popular colors[^9]
- **Brown and Tan**: Less expensive, functionally identical[^9]

Price variations depend on your Charisma stat. Characters with high Charisma (110+) receive the lowest prices; low Charisma results in higher prices within each bridle type range.[^2]

### Silken Bridles

#### Named Drops
Silken bridles drop from Named creatures in Sanctus Seru and Ssraeshza Temple:
- **Praesertums (Sanctus Seru)**: Approximately 10% drop rate
    - [Praesertum Bikun](https://www.eqarchives.com/npcs/view/159052){target=_blank} - Drops the Tan Silken Bridle at 15% drop rate
    - [Praesertum Matpa](https://www.eqarchives.com/npcs/view/159035){target=_blank} - Drops the White Silken Bridle at 9.91% drop rate
    - [Praesertum Rhugol](https://www.eqarchives.com/npcs/view/159054){target=_blank} - Drops the Black Silken Bridle at 10.989% drop rate
    - [Praesertum Vantorus](https://www.eqarchives.com/npcs/view/159055){target=_blank} - Drops the Brown Silken Bridle at 7.547% drop rate
- **Commanders (Ssraeshza Temple)**: Approximately 1% drop rate [^9]
    - [Commander Zazuzh](https://www.eqarchives.com/npcs/view/162003){target=_blank} - Drops the Tan, White, Black, and Brown Silken Bridles at 0.236% drop rate [^10]
    - [Commander Zherozsh](https://www.eqarchives.com/npcs/view/162027){target=_blank} - Drops the Tan, White, Black, and Brown Silken Bridles at 0.236% drop rate [^11]
- [Grieg Veneficus](https://www.eqarchives.com/npcs/view/163389){target=_blank}: Drops the Black Silken Bridle at 11.11% drop rate [^12]

#### Vendor Purchased
[Stable Hand Kaye](https://www.eqarchives.com/npcs/view/151242){target=_blank} - sells them in the Bazaar stables for 58K (Tan, Brown) or 62K (Black, White)

Silk bridle horses effectively vendor for around 50,000 platinum pieces. [^9]

Silken Bridles can be traded to NPCs in the Bazaar.[^5]

> **Note - TLP/Modern Changes**: As of the September 2017 patch on live servers, Silken Bridles were replaced with Ornate Silken Bridles. The new bridles cannot be traded for Platinum and no longer drop from Luclin Named creatures. This change was likely implemented to reduce the incentive for permanent camping of Named encounters.[^7]

### Ornate Chain Bridles (Raid Drops)

Ornate Chain bridles are raid boss drops only:
- **Lord Inquisitor Seru** (Sanctus Seru): Drops Ornate Chain horse
- **Emperor Ssraeshza** (Ssraeshza Temple): Drops Ornate Chain horse [^9]

These are the fastest bridles available through normal gameplay and provide an 85% movement speed increase.

### Trader NPCs in The Bazaar

In the Bazaar stables, the Amondson brothers operate a bridle buyback program: Wendal Amondson buys BLACK bridles, Aldo Amondson buys BROWN bridles, Galic Amondson buys WHITE bridles, and Hiklo Amondson buys TAN bridles.[^8]

Players can turn in a bridle and receive a "big bag of platinum" which sells for roughly 85% of the horse's value. [^9]

> **Note on Buyback Value Discrepancy**: Earlier EverQuest guides documented bridle buyback values at approximately 2/3 (66%) of the purchase price.[^6] The TAKP server shows improved buyback value at approximately 85%. This could reflect server-specific implementations, historical patches that improved the buyback rate, or variations between different EverQuest server codebases.

### Quest Bridles

#### Bridle of Sir Ariam (Befallen Quest)

The Bridle of Sir Ariam quest takes place in Befallen and involves spawning Sir Ariam Arcanum and the Foreman. Completing the quest yields a one-time use Bridle of Sir Ariam that summons a horse once before vanishing. [^4] The initial Ghostly Bridle received from Sir Ariam is No-Rent, but if turned in at Freeport or Neriak vendors, you receive a non-No-Rent version. [^4] 

This quest was originally intended as a preview for players to test horses before purchasing them. [^4] The quest involves killing excavating skeletons to spawn the Foreman (approximately 19-minute respawn timer), which then allows Sir Ariam Arcanum to spawn. [^4]

## Mount Speed Comparison

Speed progression from slowest to fastest:
- Rope Bridle: 25% faster than base movement
- Leather Bridle: 50% faster than base movement
- Silken Bridle: 60% faster than base movement  
- Chain Bridle: 70% faster than base movement
- Ornate Chain Bridle: 85% faster than base movement [^9]

For reference, silk bridles are faster than Journeyman's Boots (Jboots) and Spirit of Wolf spells, while Chain bridles are significantly faster than silk bridles. [^8]

## Zone Mount Restrictions

Mounts cannot be used in:
- All interior city areas (Katta Castellum, Sanctus Seru, Shar Vahl, Shadow Haven)
- Dungeon and cave zones (Ssraeshza Temple, Vex Thal, and similar indoor zones)
- Instances and special encounter zones

*Note: Consult individual zone guides for specific restrictions, as some outdoor zones may also restrict mounts.*

## Mount Usage Tips

- Mounts provide no combat advantage but offer significant convenience for travel
- The Safe Fall bonus is particularly useful when traveling in mountainous zones
- Consider the food cost when planning long grinding sessions or extended dungeon runs
- High Charisma improves vendor pricing when purchasing bridles, up to a maximum benefit at 110 Charisma[^2]
- The meditation/mana regeneration effect only applies when stationary and out of combat[^9]
