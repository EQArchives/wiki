# Mount System

Mounts were first introduced in the Shadows of Luclin expansion and provide several benefits for travel across Luclin and other outdoor zones.

## Benefits

- **Safe Fall Bonus**: Grants 150 Safe Fall, reducing fall damage
- **Meditation**: Allows you to meditate while mounted (increases mana regeneration as if sitting)
- **Combat Ready**: You can cast spells and engage in combat while mounted
- **Increased Speed**: Varies by bridle type (see Mount Speeds below)

## Limitations

- **Food Consumption**: Mounts consume food at twice the normal rate (feeding both you and the mount)
- **Illusion Conflicts**: Mounts cannot be used simultaneously with most illusions, though you can maintain buffs from both
- **Indoor Restrictions**: Mounts are unavailable in indoor zones (dungeons, caves, and interior city areas)
- **Zone Restrictions**: Several outdoor zones do not permit mount use

## Mount Acquisition

Mounts are summoned and controlled using **Bridles**. Different bridle types produce different mount appearances and speeds.

### Bridle Types, Speeds, and Prices

| Bridle Type | Movement Speed Increase | Vendor Price | Availability |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rope Bridle | ~25% | 8,400-12,300pp | Bazaar vendor |
| Leather Bridle | ~50% | 27,300-41,000pp | Bazaar vendor |
| Silken Bridle | ~60% | 60,900-84,800pp | Bazaar vendor or Named drops |
| Chain Bridle | ~70% | 95,600-135,400pp | Bazaar vendor |
| Ornate Chain Bridle | ~85% | Drop only | Lord Seru & Emperor Ssraeshza |
| Ghostly Bridle (Quest) | ~25% | N/A | Befallen quest (1-use) |

### Bridle Coloring and Pricing

Bridles come in four colors: **Black, White, Brown, and Tan**. Color affects pricing but not functionality.

- **Black and White**: More expensive and popular colors
- **Brown and Tan**: Less expensive, functionally identical

Price variations depend on your Charisma stat. Characters with high Charisma (110+) receive the lowest prices; low Charisma results in higher prices within each bridle type range.

### Silken Bridles (Named Drops)

Silken Bridles drop from Named creatures throughout Luclin zones and can be traded to NPCs in the Bazaar.  Galic Amondson in the Bazaar stables will trade silken bridles for approximately 49,300-49,500 platinum pieces, which you receive in a Bag of Platinum Pieces that can then be sold to any NPC vendor. 

> **Note - TLP/Modern Changes**: As of the September 2017 patch, Silken Bridles were replaced with Ornate Silken Bridles. The new bridles cannot be traded for Platinum and no longer drop from Luclin Named creatures. This change was likely implemented to reduce the incentive for permanent camping of Named encounters.

### Trader NPCs in The Bazaar

In the Bazaar stables, the Amondson brothers operate a bridle buyback program: Wendal Amondson buys BLACK bridles, Aldo Amondson buys BROWN bridles, Galic Amondson buys WHITE bridles, and Hiklo Amondson buys TAN bridles.  Players receive a Bag of Platinum Pieces worth approximately 2/3 of the original bridle cost. 

### Quest Bridles

#### Bridle of Sir Ariam (Befallen Quest)

The Bridle of Sir Ariam quest takes place in Befallen and involves spawning Sir Ariam Arcanum and the Foreman. Completing the quest yields a one-time use Bridle of Sir Ariam that summons a horse once before vanishing.  The initial Ghostly Bridle received from Sir Ariam is No-Rent, but if turned in at Freeport or Neriak vendors, you receive a non-No-Rent version.  

This quest was originally intended as a preview for players to test horses before purchasing them.  The quest involves killing excavating skeletons to spawn the Foreman (approximately 19-minute respawn timer), which then allows Sir Ariam Arcanum to spawn. 

## Mount Speed Comparison

Speed progression from slowest to fastest:
- Rope Bridle: ~25% faster than base movement
- Leather Bridle: ~50% faster than base movement
- Silken Bridle: ~60% faster than base movement  
- Chain Bridle: ~70% faster than base movement
- Ornate Chain Bridle: ~85% faster than base movement 

For reference, silk bridles are faster than Journeyman's Boots (Jboots) and Spirit of Wolf spells, while Chain bridles are significantly faster than silk bridles. 

>In-Game using Zeal currently shows a discrepancy of +125% and +150% respectively for silken and chain bridles sold by the stable vendors in the Bazaar. More to follow.

## Zone Mount Restrictions

Mounts cannot be used in:
- All interior city areas (Katta Castellum, Sanctus Seru, Shar Vahl, Shadow Haven)
- Dungeon and cave zones (Ssraeshza Temple, Vex Thal, and similar indoor zones)
- Instances and special encounter zones

*Note: Consult individual zone guides for specific restrictions, as some outdoor zones may also restrict mounts.*

## Mount Usage Tips

- Mounts provide no combat advantage but offer significant convenience for travel
- The Safe Fall bonus is particularly useful when traveling in mountainous zones like the Tenebrous Mountains or Dawnshroud Peaks
- Consider the food cost when planning long grinding sessions or extended dungeon runs
- Remember to dismiss your mount when entering restricted zones to avoid dismounting penalties
- High Charisma improves vendor pricing when purchasing bridles, up to a maximum benefit at 110 Charisma
