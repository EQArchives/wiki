# Mount System

Mounts were first introduced in the Shadows of Luclin expansion and provide several benefits for travel across Luclin and other outdoor zones.

## Benefits

- **Safe Fall Bonus**: Grants 150 Safe Fall, reducing fall damage
- **Meditation**: Allows you to meditate while mounted (increases mana regeneration as if sitting)
- **Combat Ready**: You can cast spells and engage in combat while mounted
- **Increased Speed**: Varies by mount type (see Mount Speeds below)

## Limitations

- **Food Consumption**: Mounts consume food at twice the normal rate (feeding both you and the mount)
- **Illusion Conflicts**: Mounts cannot be used simultaneously with most illusions, though you can maintain buffs from both
- **Indoor Restrictions**: Mounts are unavailable in indoor zones (dungeons, caves, and interior city areas)
- **Zone Restrictions**: Several outdoor zones do not permit mount use

## Mount Acquisition

### Bridles
Mounts are summoned and controlled using **Bridles**. Different bridle types produce different mount appearances and speeds.

**Silken Bridles** (Named Drops)
- Dropped by Named creatures throughout Luclin zones
- Can be traded to NPCs in the Bazaar for Platinum currency
- Available colors: Black, Brown, Tan, White

> **Note - TLP/Modern Changes**: As of the September 2017 patch, Silken Bridles were replaced with Ornate Silken Bridles. The new bridles cannot be traded for Platinum and no longer drop from Luclin Named creatures. This change was likely implemented to reduce the incentive for permanent camping of Named encounters.

### Bridle Types and Sources

| Bridle Type | Speed | Rarity | Appearance |
|---|---|---|---|
| Silken Bridles | Fast | Rare (Named drops) | Elegant, decorated |
| Ornate Chain Bridles | Very Fast | Rare (Named drops) | Heavy armored |
| Leather Bridles | Moderate | Uncommon | Standard saddle |
| Chain Bridles | Moderate | Uncommon | Light armor |
| Rope Bridles | Slow | Common | Basic |
| Guide Issue Bridles | Slow | Common | Standard issue |

**Special Bridles**:
- **Bejeweled Bridle**: Gem-encrusted appearance
- **Bridle of Sir Ariam**: Quest reward or special acquisition
- **Ghostly Bridle**: Ghostly/spectral mount appearance
- **War Boar Bridle**: Unique war boar mount

## Mount Speeds

From slowest to fastest:

1. Immobile (stationary only)
2. Very Slow
3. Slow
4. Moderate
5. Fast
6. Very Fast
7. Ludicrous (rare, high-end mounts)

## Zone Mount Restrictions

Mounts cannot be used in:
- All indoor/dungeon zones
- Interior city areas
- Instances and special encounter zones
- Specific restricted outdoor zones (varies by zone design)

*Note: Consult individual zone guides for specific restrictions.*

## Mount Usage Tips

- Mounts provide no combat advantage but offer convenience for travel
- The Safe Fall bonus is particularly useful when traveling in mountainous zones
- Consider the food cost when planning long grinding sessions
- Remember to dismiss your mount when entering restricted zones to avoid dismounting penalties
