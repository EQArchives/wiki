# Mount System
Mounts have a secret bonus of 150 Safe Fall, allow you to meditate faster (as if sitting), but you can still cast spells and do combat. They do have one set back, however, You consume food at twice the normal rate (you got to feed the mount too).  Mounts can not be used simultaneously with most illusions (but you can have the buffs from both). Also, there are zones where you are not allowed to use mounts (usually zones that are considered indoor zones).   

>Silken Bridles will drop from many of the Luclin Named (Rares) until much later in the September 2017 patch, where they are replaced with Ornate Silken Bridles. Unlike the Silken Bridles, Ornate Silken Bridles can not be traded to an NPC in Bazaar (a way to acquire Platinum for the Bridles). This may have been an effort to address the perma-camping of these Named, by certain Players. In any case, while Players may still have Silken Bridles, they do not drop anymore.
