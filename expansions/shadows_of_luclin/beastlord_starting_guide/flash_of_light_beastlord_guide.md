# Flash of Light

*A comprehensive guide by Kraggan Swampdragon*

Flash of Light is one of the Beastlord's best and most under-utilized spells. It's a life-saver when soloing, a ghetto fear spell, a ghetto mez spell, a fast-casting taunter, and a fantastic emergency "get off the caster" tool—all for minimal mana and casting time.

---

## Use Cases

### 1. Life-Saver When Soloing

If your warder dies or hasn't been summoned yet, a quick Flash of Light (easily cast between blows) followed by backing out of melee range will cause the mob to take off running. This gives you plenty of time to make your escape.

**Important:** Watch the mob's fear-pathing. If it runs in the same direction you're heading, you've lost your advantage.

### 2. Ghetto Fear Spell

For particularly tough solo mobs you wouldn't normally beat, Flash of Light functions like fear-kiting. You simply keep recasting FoL to maintain the highest aggro on you while the mob flees.

**How it works:** When a mob is blinded, it will run away as if feared—*but only if* the person at #1 on its hate list is not in melee range. If you cast FoL and the mob doesn't run, your #1 hate target is still fighting in melee. Once that person steps back, the mob will run until FoL wears off.

**To fear-kite effectively:** Make sure your warder is NOT out-aggro'ing you. The best way to prevent this is constant FoL recasting. You can also layer in a DoT or two, though casting longer spells while the mob is running away and unsnared is difficult.

**Aggro tip:** If you cast FoL and the mob keeps hitting someone else, recasting FoL several times will often pull aggro onto you. If you're standing back while casting, the mob will head for the hills.

### 3. Ghetto Mez

You will get adds. If your group has a competent enchanter, you're fine. Without one, using Flash of Light to keep adds entertained is a great way to avoid corpse recovery stress. Simply keep recasting it on them as they approach until the main mob is defeated.

**With Root:** If someone in your party has Root, FoL is excellent for moving the mob away from the group before it gets rooted.

### 4. Fast-Cast Taunter

While other spells may taunt more effectively, none cast as quickly or cheaply as Flash of Light. This is critical for maximizing your melee output—you want to miss as few swings as possible.

**Additional benefit:** If an eager wizard nukes the mob while it's blinded by FoL, the mob will run away instead of retaliating on the caster. This mechanic will become even more valuable when the swing-timer reset bug on spell casting is fixed.

### 5. Emergency "Get Off the Caster" Spell

This spell has saved countless casters (and even a few low-HP tanks) in group content.

**If the caster is already running:** FoL will instantly make the mob turn tail because the target is already moving away from melee range.

**If the caster is standing still:** Flash the mob first, then quickly tell the caster to back up. Once they exit melee range, the mob will abandon them and run.

## Summary

Flash of Light earns permanent gem-slot status through its versatility and efficiency. Its combination of low mana cost, fast casting time, and multiple tactical applications makes it an essential tool for Beastlord survival and group utility.
