## Stat Overview

### Wisdom
**Iksars** come out as having the most smarts, which will mean you will have more mana and be able to raise non-melee skills quicker. **Trolls** have the worst starting wisdom and won't have as much mana. The other races are all average in wisdom.

### Stamina & Strength
**Ogres** have the best Stamina and Strength, which will make them better meleers. They won't run out of stamina as quickly when using heavy weapons and also have the most HP. **Iksars** are the weakest with the least amount of HP. **Trolls** and **Barbarians** also have higher HP than the other races but not as much as Ogres. **Vah Shir** are average.

### Agility
**Iksar** and **Vah Shir** have the highest Agility, which will give them slightly better AC. Iksars also have their AC bonus, which is even better. **Ogres** have the worst Agility.

### Charisma
**Vah Shir** have the best Charisma, which will cut down the cost of items compared to **Ogres**, who have the worst. This isn't very important in the later levels, but it can make an untwinked newbie character's life easier to have higher Charisma.

### Dexterity
Not the most important stat. Dexterity helps weapon procs go off more often (but not drastically), and it also helps raise melee skills quicker. **Iksars** have the highest Dexterity.

## Race Abilities

### Barbarian

**Gods:** Mithaniel Marr, The Tribunal  
**EXP Mod:** +5% extra to level

#### Advantages
- **Slam:** Good for stunning mobs since BL kick can't stun
- **Good faction in all good cities:** Makes life easier. Easy to find banks and vendors

#### Disadvantages
- **Blind in dark:** You're forced to carry light stones until high levels when BL get spells to fix it. Still hard to see in outdoor zones even with light stones

---

### Iksar

**Gods:** Cazic-Thule  
**EXP Mod:** +20% extra to level

#### Advantages
- **Regen:** Double the HP gain is always good at any level. It's less mana you and others have to spend on healing. Mostly useful while meditating then healing yourself after you're done meditating
- **Swimming starts at 100:** Means less hassle trying to learn it later. Most of us will need swimming eventually. Very useful on PVP servers where it can be an early edge over slower swimming foes. But it's still nothing too useful when you're fighting out of water
- **Forage:** Capped at 50 and only useful before we get summon food and water. Not really important at all
- **Scale skin AC bonus:** Iksars have an AC bonus which isn't anything to ignore since BLs armor selection isn't all that great. It's about +1 AC every other level; at level 60 they would have an extra 40 AC
- **Infravision:** Lets you see in the dark well enough to get around. Not as good as Ultravision

#### Disadvantages
- **+20% Exp Penalty:** Tied with Trolls for the worst exp penalty in the game. Just means you will level a little slower than the other BL races
- **Hated:** Iksars are KOS in all cities in the old world and all cities in Kunark except for Cabilis. It's hard to get good faction in most cities. But they like Iksars in Temple of Cazic Thule. They are not KOS in Ice Dorf town in Velious, Shadowhaven, and Cat town on the moon
- **Can't wear plate:** Well, since Beastlords can't wear plate anyway this doesn't really matter much. But there are a few plate wrist items other BL races can use. Not a big loss for Iksars though

---

### Ogre

**Gods:** Rallos Zek  
**EXP Mod:** +15% extra to level

#### Advantages
- **Slam:** Good for stunning mobs since BL kick can't stun
- **Can't be stunned from front:** Less stuns is good
- **Lots o' hit points:** This drives most clerics insane too
- **Infravision:** Lets you see in the dark well enough to get around. Not as good as Ultravision

#### Disadvantages
- **Evil:** Only not KOS in Dark Elf, Troll, and Ogre Cities. Also not KOS in Evil fort in Kunark, Ice Dorf town in Velious, and some cities on Luclin
- **Big:** Only an annoyance most of the time. You will get stuck more often in dungeons than the smaller races will. And you get in other people's way

---

### Troll

**Gods:** Cazic-Thule, Innoruuk  
**EXP Mod:** +20% extra to level

#### Advantages
- **Regen:** Double the HP gain is always good at any level. It's less mana you and others have to spend on healing. Mostly useful while meditating then healing yourself after you're done meditating
- **Slam:** Good for stunning mobs since BL kick can't stun
- **Infravision:** Lets you see in the dark well enough to get around. Not as good as Ultravision

#### Disadvantages
- **+20% Exp Penalty:** Tied with Iksars for the worst exp penalty in the game. Just means you will level a little slower than the other BL races
- **Big:** Only an annoyance most of the time. You will get stuck more often in dungeons than the smaller races will. And you get in other people's way
- **Evil:** Only not KOS in Dark Elf, Troll, and Ogre Cities. Also not KOS in Evil fort in Kunark, Ice Dorf town in Velious, and some cities on Luclin

### Vah Shir

**Gods:** Agnostic  
**EXP Mod:** None

#### Advantages
- **Sneak:** Good for getting past some mobs before we get invisibility. Also very useful for getting vendors that don't like you to sell to you
- **Safe Fall:** Makes traveling safer. Less annoying falls for 1-10 damage while going down hills
- **Good faction in all good cities:** Makes life easier. Easy to find banks and vendors
- **High Stamina Regen:** Vah Shir's stamina bar will regenerate twice as fast as every other race. Won't need to be shouting for Zing every 5 seconds when using heavy weapons
- **Infravision:** Lets you see in the dark well enough to get around. Not as good as Ultravision

#### Disadvantages
- **Big:** Only an annoyance most of the time. You will get stuck more often in dungeons than the smaller races will. And you get in other people's way
- **Consume Food Faster:** Cats eat food and drink twice as fast as all other races. Just need to carry more

## Pet Types

There's no known difference in kinds of pets other than the way they look.

| Race | Pet Type |
|------|----------|
| Barbarian | Normal Wolves |
| Iksar | Scaled Wolves (mini Dinosaurs) |
| Ogre | Brown Bears |
| Troll | Alligators |
| Vah Shir | Tigers |

## Other Considerations

### Starting Zones & Hunting Grounds
Iksars have the best level 1-20 hunting grounds of any other race. They will have the easiest time in those levels finding mobs to kill. Field of Bone is the best newbie zone in the game. The Vah Shir also have good hunting grounds on the moon with well-designed zones. Barbarians have the third best hunting grounds with lots of weak animals that drop items for tailoring.

### Population & Trends
Most Beastlords are also Vah Shir since they're new, so if you don't like being the new fad race then don't pick the cats. At least 80% of Beastlords are Vah Shir on most servers.

### Quests
Vah Shir currently have the best quests. The other races' quests seemed like Verant spent 10 minutes making them.

### Gear & Equipment
Most Beastlord weapons and armor drop on the moon, so plan on taking a Lunar module there eventually. Vah Shir start there so they have better access to the items. But the moon is a very laggy place on most people's computers and might be very annoying to go there. You'll get mixed reports on how good the zones there are for camping and exp—most say it's OK exp, others say it sucks.
