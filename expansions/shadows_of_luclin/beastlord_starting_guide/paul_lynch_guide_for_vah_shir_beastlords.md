# Guide for Vah Shir Beastlords

## Introduction
This guide is a comprehensive guide for a new Vah Shir beastlord. I don't tell you how to play Everquest, and I don't give you detailed walkthroughs of any of the quests; but I will point you at useful places to start. My starting point is an assumption that you play a [Vah Shir](/character/races/vah-shir) because you are interested in the race, and a [Beastlord](/character/classes/beastlord) because the class interests you, and so will be inclined to "role play" a little more than the norm (which is exactly zero, btw). I'll take you through native Vah Shir hunting grounds as well as the game tutorial, and point out the quests and rewards. If you want to powerlevel and twink, that's up to you, but a lot of what I have to say won't be of any interest to you. If you are still interested in reading further, you've made a good choice! 

### Why Vah Shir?

The Vah Shir have one of the best starting areas and newbie quest series in the game. They also have significant leveling advantages:

- **Fast teen-level progression**: The Vah Shir also have the potential to progress through their teen levels faster than any other race, thanks to their proximity to Paludal Caverns. Most people know Paludal only for the bandit camps next to the Shadowhaven entrance, but the Shadeweavers and Hollowshade entrances can take you from 6 all the way up to 24 with a very smooth progression, and very rapidly thanks to the experience bonus Paludal offers. 
  
- **Limited loot economy**: Another important point is that money is very scarce in the Vah Shir areas, and players used to more generous loot elsewhere (plague rat tails dropping from level 1 rats, for instance) will be surprised. You have to learn to manage your resources intelligently, and sufficient money will come. Shamans, with expensive spells to purchase, will suffer the most, but there is no reason that a beastlord should feel any pinch. 

- **Excellent solo capability**: With most classes (druid and shaman, for example) when soloing I adopt a strict strategy of taking one blue at a time; with a beastlord, I can confidently take on a white, or several dark blues, and often yellows. Beastlords can solo with confidence, certainly well into their thirties and forties, and can make it to 65-75, although grouping becomes much faster as you hit the higher reaches.

### About This Guide

Because of the nature of the Vah Shir and their starting area, Shar Vahl, a lot of this information applies to other Vah Shir classes - but I have only run a [Beastlord](/character/classes/beastlord) there (well, and a [Bard](/character/classes/bard); and had a lot of input from a Vah Shir [Shaman](/character/classes/shaman)), so I can't entirely vouch for its accuracy for classes other than Beastlord.

## Creation
 I generally stick with the suggestions given on eq.castersrealm.com for new classes; so do as they advise and stick all your points into wisdom, as this directly affects your spell casting abilities once you get them, and will be the most beneficial at higher levels. Otherwise, you have no real choices that will affect your character in any meaningful way. The character creation screen suggest that stamina, agility, wisdom and charisma are all important for beastlords; which seems like very suspicious advice to me.

The above paragraph is all you need if you are in a hurry to get started, but if you need to know why, here is my explanation. For a caster class, you generally want them to have a large mana pool, which is done by increasing their wisdom attribute (or int, for int based casters). This can be done by starting points, or by equipment. Generally speaking, it is easy to raise wis, int and strength, far more so than other attributes, with equipment. For a melee class, strength is the primary attribute that influences how often they will hit for max damage. Charisma mainly has an effect only on vendor buying and selling prices, apart from bards and enchanters. Dexterity affects how rapidly melee skills increase, and how often a weapon procs, or casts it's special effect if it has one, and so is of specialised use. Stamina and agility are more interesting: they are hard to raise by gear, and stamina raises hit points, and agility raises armor class - but both have very much smaller impact for casters, rather more of one for melee and hybrid classes. These attributes, hit points and armor class, are easier to raise directly with equipment.

As a hybrid, both melee and casting attributes are important. Depending on how you will play your character, you can choose to favour one approach or the other. I can tell you that hybrids in a group rarely get a chance to meditate, so a large mana pool is more important than it may at first glance seem to be, and will generally get healed when required, so a large hit points total isn't vitally essential. For a soloer, and a beastlord is an excellent soloer, better melee stats are important, but then so is having a reasonable mana pool to minimise down time. At low levels, hit points matter more than anything else; at mid levels, a solo beastlord is likely to spend 1/3 of his time in combat meleeing, and 2/3 playing cleric for his warder; then at higher levels the solo beastlord will spend more and more time meleeing alongside their warder. However, beastlords can self buff all statistics apart from wisdom and agility; in a raid, agility will be buffed as well, and besides agility only has a minor impact on armor class. For this reason only, we should put points into wisdom at the start.

### Tutorial

You should really start by doing the tutorial, even if you are an experienced player.

### First Steps

Once your character is created, you will appear in the beastlord guild area in Shar Vahl (assuming that you took the choice to start in Shar Vahl - that's what this guide is about, after all). Before doing anything else, check your inventory, and read your starting note, which will tell you to give the note to your guildmaster. Do this, and you will be given the starting instructions for the citizenship quest that every Vah Shir has to pursue, and is required for most other training quests in Shar Vahl - and takes you straight to level 2 - or very close to it. While you are in front of your guildmaster, you might put five training points in your starting weapon skill, piercing (but if you have access to better weapons immediately, skip piercing and train in H2H or 1HB, as these are generally better all round or cheap weapon types for beastlords).

Outside is a room full of scribes selling shaman and beastlord spells, with a door to the left leading to the arena, and the warriors and rogues guilds; and to the right, a door leading to the main palace.

Feel free to explore Shar Vahl a little at first; you can use backspace or the "m" key to bring up a map of the city with key features marked. 

## The Mines of Gloomingdeep (Level 1-10/15)
 When you create your character, you have the option of starting in the Tutorial zone (the button that enables this is set on by default). You should do this, even if you are an experienced player, for several reasons. First, you get a charm with very nice statistics on it, as well as the possibility of getting some basic weapons, armor and some bags and even a little money for no cost. Secondly, when you leave you will be at least level 2, and anywhere up to level 15. Third, you can leave very well buffed, enough to give you a decent lift in your next hunting session. If you are a genuine beginner, then the knowledge imparted by running through the tutorial is excellent - which is why I will not repeat any of that here.

You start in the tutorial zone, Mines of Gloomingdeep. You have to run through the initial quest with Arias (Jail Break!) and the kobold jailer to enter the main mines zone. There is little to do here apart from follow instructions, and listen to (and read) some basic help information. That will put you at level 2. Take the Arias: Basic Training quest, and run through it to get the Kobold Skull charm. Take Arias: Rally with Rahtiz.

In the next zone, there will be other players - start by following the instructions to get the Kobold Skull Charm, which is a lot better than most charm drops in 50+ zones that you will reach without raiding - with one exception, that you can obtain in Crescent Reach at an early level. Along the way, Absor will upgrade your 3/24 newbie dagger to 3/22, gain a new spell called Salve (heals 5 hp for 10 mana), and an ac 2 Kobold Leather Mask. By this time, your charm has +5 wis, int, str, sta, and +10 hp and mana. Pozzik will give you an AC 2 Kobold Leather Mask, and his lost sword may also be a minor upgrade; he isn't part of the training quest, so watch out for him. Frizznik's baking is superceded by skill-up quests in Crescent Reach, but gives some very minor stat food (rat steaks, +5 hp). One probable bug: Rahtan used to refer melee characters to another NPC to get their level 1 tomes, but this no longer happens - they will have to buy them in PoK/Crescent Reach.

Now for some more useful information. Any time the buff runs out, return to Rytan and say "I want to be blessed" (this is a 97 hp buff).

Start with the rats and bats and spiders quests: Rahtiz: Clearing the Vermin Nests (stitched burlap leggings), Rebellion Reloaded (just exp, I think); and Vyrinn: Spider Caves, Spider Tamer Gugan. You should be able to clear all of these in 20-40 minutes, and be level 4/5; Gugan is level 5, and may be a little tough for his level. This leaves just the Arachnidia quest to kill Queen Gloomfang, who is level 7. Save this for later.

Run in and kill. Start with the spiders and rats, and loot anything they drop. Use /open (also in the Actions window) to open vermin nests, piles of bones, and barrels; you won't believe how hard they can be to open if you just attack them. Sell most items to the merchant, but keep the gloomingdeep silks and give them three at a time, unstacked, to Vahlara. She will give you some random stitched burlap armor, which is equivalent to cloth. Equip it, and sell spares to the merchant.

Stepping out to run the Plane of Knowledge quests at this point may be the best plan (see below). Back in the mines...

When you are level 4 or higher, move further in and kill kobolds; take the tasks from Guards Hobart and Maddoc. Hobart: Battle of Gloomingdeep; Maddoc: Kobold Leadership. Find Zajeer and Kaikachi while killing grunts and warriors. Stay with grunts at first, but move on to the warriors when you feel comfortable. A rare drop from these is a chunk of bronze, which is no drop. You can hand this in to Absor for an improved dagger (Bronze Gloomingdeep Dagger, 4/23). There are named kobolds, which often drop spells. While you are in the kobold area, open the barrels - some will gives you free small bags, and the forlorn bows sell for decent cash (1pp+ each).

Next find the two scouts in a side tunnel. Zajeer: Scouting Gloomingdeep, Sabotage; Kaikachi: Goblin Treachery, Busted Locks. Use the scouting task to get to the fort to execute Sabotage; the supplies crate is to the left as you enter; you will have to kill or pass 2 or 3 captains to do this. Come back to Zajeer and kill goblin slaves on the way. The locksmith is nearby, up the passage to the north. If you still need slaves and slave wardens, go into the pit - Rockfynn is along one of the side passages, and is level 7 (or 6).

Go back and kill Queen Gloomfang if you haven't already. Reward is a few celestial healing potions.

After this activity the only three quests remaining should be: Hobart: Freedom's Stand; and Maddoc: Pit Fiend. You can only get the latter after completing the Battle quest (may be level limited?), which also gives you some Gloomleather leggings. For Freedom's Stand you have to clear the fort, and kill the level 10 boss there, Overlord Grikan. When you succeed, check the area for lootable boxes which may have some nice items in. Grikan is probably the easiest of these three, and Hobart will give you a Gloomleather tunic for killing him. The pit fiend is a level 12 boss; he doesn't hit very hard, so a level 10 character with a damage shield potion should be able to take him. The final quest is Flutterwing's Dilemma from the main camp. Slavemaster Ruga, level 9, summons two guards when you attack him, so make sure to pull him away from his spawn point; you may be lucky and get him with no adds. I think he is harder than Krenshin (the pit fiend).

At this point I would switch to Crescent Reach, although it is certainly possible to spend all your time in one or the other. The value of Gloomingdeep is the charm, plus an easy way to get some very basic armor. Switching to Crescent Reach at this point lets you skip some grinding in Gloomingdeep, and pick up some much better armor. The old newbie quest armors are also better than the gloom armors, although how easy they are to obtain varies considerably with class and location (hint: all berserker quests are excessively easy). When you are ready to leave, remember to get a final buff from Rytan.

### Plane of Knowledge

There are two ways to leave the mines: through the doorway/tunnel into your home city (Crescent Reach), or by saying to Arias: "ready to leave". This takes you to the Plane of Knowledge. I would recommend the latter for some quick quest experience; take Arias's advice, and go to find Vivian the True, at the entrance to the Library. Her several small quests give significant exp at low levels. To get to Crescent Reach, go back into the tutorial from your character select screen.

You can stay in the Mines until level 15; at 16, you can no longer return. But you can't enter from the character select screen; the solution is to stay bound in the Mines, and use Gate (for casters only) to return. After level 10, the tutorial button on the character select screen is disabled. Up to 10, the Tutorial button is a quick way back to the Plane of Knowledge without a long run, or into Crescent Reach - also without a long run through Blightfire Moors.

Once you are level 10, some more quests become active in PoK; check with Vivian the True once more. She will send you to an armor quest NPC (one good, one evil), who I think will refuse to speak to people with a home in Crescent Reach (or Shar Vahl - they only speak to you if your home city and class has a newbie armor quest). She also gives a third, neutral quest giver: Castlen Drewe: Haunted Butcherblock, this requires level 11, and the reward is a Ghostly Mantle. Castlen has several quests to give, one per level up to 15/16, and a last one at 19. The armor NPCs give out pieces of the newbie quest armor, and if you have been levelling in Crescent Reach, this isn't likely to be an upgrade, although it is an improvement over the Gloomingdeep armors. Castlen's quests fill out most of the non-visible slots, and are high quality.

While in this level range and passing through PoK, get the Fine Antique Ring. Find Curator Merri in one of the buildings on the good side, and get her Collecting Box (just talk to her). Then you need to combine four items in it. A cockatrice beak, a high quality cougarskin, a tiny rockhopper eye, and an undead froglok tongue. You will need to buy the skin in the Bazaar (unless you are already 30ish!), so hold off on this quest until you can afford one; the alternative is a merchant diving trip to the gnomes in Iceclad to see if anyone has sold one to them (take the boat from North Ro). The other items can also be bought there; this will be cheaper for the beak than trying to hunt one, or buying one from a vendor. The tongue can be found from frogloks in Qeynos Catacombs near Cubert (fine if you aren't kill on sight there or can invis), and the eye from vendors in Shar Vahl, or from level 1 rockhoppers in the pit under the city. Tongues can also often be found on vendors in many other places. This ring has the mana preservation II focus. Also consider the mask quest (the Forgotten Pools) for spell haste II. This involves talking to the guys sitting next to the pools on the good side of PoK, and giving in a sarnak blood (Bazaar/merchants again, or a trip to the newbie yard area of Lake of Ill Omen, which isn't without its perils). You then need to make a run into Droga, so make sure that you have a good invis - the 10pp, instant cast cloudy potions may be an option for clerics and warriors, and make sure you take more than one. 

## Citizenship and Learning Shar Vahl (Level 1 - 2)
**Objectives**: Learn Shar Vahl, containers

One of the objectives of the citizenship quest is presumably to get you familiar with the layout of Shar Vahl; to cut this short, it helps to know that there is a basic symmetry to its plan - the palace in the centre (and to the west), a high class merchant area to the east of the palace with the arena at the far east, and slum/merchant areas to both the north and south of the central merchant area. From the north slum leads a bridge to Hollowshade, and from the south slum a bridge to Shadeweavers. At the far end of either bridge you can climb down into the pit underneath Shar Vahl.

Your guild leader has sent you to Registrar Bindarah, who is in a building adjacent to the south gate. She in turn will send you to the tax collector, in the bank in the central merchant district, and to Mignah, who is upstairs in a tavern next to the north gate. From there you return to Bindarah, who will send you to see King Raja in the palace, and then to return to your guild master. At this point the experience given from this quest may have made you level 2 already (this did the first time I ran it, but didn't the second).

If you need help finding these NPCs, try the Find button on your menus, or try asking the guards for directions.

While exploring Shar Vahl, you should start the basic trade skill quests appropriate for beastlords, all of which require you to hand over your citizenship slate. The beastlord claws quest starts in the beastlord guild, with Animist Poren (270, 50) once you have returned with your slate; you will be given your first container for this quest, the beastlord sewing kit. Beastlords should also do the tailoring quest, which starts with Broker Fahaar (225, -25) in the narrow corridor between the palace and the merchant district, and gives a container (you will need a total of 16 young rockhopper hides for this). There is also a fletching quest, which may or may not be useful for beastlords - see Rytan (-400, 400) in the south merchant area to start this, and which also gives you a container.

All these quests will have given you a long list of items to collect. Young rockhopper hides, which drop from young rockhoppers in the pit, xakra teeth from xakra worms in the pit, and shadeling silks from Xakra worms/larvae. You should also have a couple of containers to use to store all these items you must collect.

While you are exploring the city, you may notice a young Vah Shir female called Shainai walking around - hail her, and follow instructions. You should end up with a little money, plus a compass. With care, you can sell this compass for 2pp, by going to the right merchants. If you need money, this quest can be repeated, which is most easily done by waiting on the palace steps for Shainai to turn up.

Once you get bored with all this, which will happen very quickly, the question is, where to start hunting? You can start in the pit, or can go out into Shadeweavers; as the newbie area in Shadeweavers is slightly safer, and Shadeweavers, in contrast to Shar Vahl, is brightly lit, I prefer Shadeweavers to start. 

## First Hunting in Shadeweavers (Levels 2 - 3)
**Objectives**: Scavengers Pack, Ghulam gloves (, Bloodling Shield)
 Out in Shadeweavers, you will see a path leading between a few tents and buildings; all of this area is mostly safe, as far as the sentry at the crossroads; the best newbie hunting is to the left as you leave the city; the bank and two merchants are on the right.

Before doing anything else, find Faer Shahar and talk to him - if you collect four items of garbage, which appear throughout the zone, including on the path and in the newbie area, and give them to him, you will get a Scavengers Bag in return. Make this a priority if you don't have any other containers yet. The garbage looks like small sacks on the ground, and seem to take on the background coloration rather more than normal dropped items do. The garbage is no rent, which means that you must collect and hand in all four pieces in a single playing session, otherwise it will disappear when you log out.

The basic hunting strategy is to select a target and autoattack - no subtlety required. Guards will protect you from anything in the zone apart from Loda Kai poachers (apparently this was fixed in a patch, and the guards no longer have a non aggression pact with poachers). When you get your kick skill (at level 5 - it should appear automatically) put it on a hot key, and use it in combat every time it becomes available. It won't make much difference at the level you get it, but it is a valuable additional attack every three or four combat tics. Don't be afraid to die - below level 6, you lose nothing and respawn with all your items, and can often rush back into the fray and kill off whatever killed you.

Kill hoppers, worms and bloodlings, saving everything that they drop. You will need shadeling silk and hopperhides for tailoring, which is essential for your beastlord quest; needle claws are also useful for tailoring, and bloodling carapaces will be used for the shield quest. Rarely the bloodlings will also drop mandibles, of which you will need four. If you run short of room, put excess baggage into the bank, which is conveniently located in the zone. When you have enough mandibles, talk to Kaza Raj, close to the Shar Vahl entrance - he is the contact point for all of the Ghulam armor quests. If you stay longer in Shadeweavers and have magic weapons, you can also kill nuisances here; they drop cloth armor (usually just a cap) and a small amount of cash.

See the trade skills page for advice on how to tailor armor as an upgrade for you, using damaged rockhopper hides.

Turn in needle claws from the hoppers to the tailoring merchant, Tiamon Aroo; he will return you a single stackable needle for each set of four claws. He also will give you the best prices to sell your loot of the two in zone merchants. You can also discover how to make Shadowed Hopperhide armor from him - this is easy, fun, and looks cool; but is nowhere near as good as Ghulam armor, although it is a step up from basic tattered hopperhide armor.

Bloodling carapaces can be collected and combined in a special container, a shield frame, that you can buy from Master Barkhem, in the smith merchant in the NW of the merchant area; do not combine your collection of carapaces just yet, until you have completed the whisperling quest in the pit later, which gives you a slightly better shield.

Without money, you still have a free source of food and drink: you can forage payala berries under the trees by the merchants, and turn them in to one of the merchants for drink - which is also saleable for small amounts, and is an excellent source of faction for non-vah shir who wish to do Shar Vahl quests.

By now, you may have some things to sell; compare prices with the different merchants, as they vary considerably. The best price in Shadeweavers will be offered by Tiamon Aroo (of the two merchants); in Shar Vahl, Chiale at the city end of the south bridge is always good, and Gherik Alarhun in the pottery merchant in the inner area may have even better prices for some items. 

## The Pit (Levels 2 - 6)
**Objectives**: Beastlord handwraps and claws, Cloak of the Khati Sha Recruit, padded cloth armor, Kick 

 Your first objective will be to make your starting claw wraps, as directed by Poren. Assuming that your tailoring skill is high enough, this will take 12 silks from xakra worms; some you will have collected already. Combining silks into threads takes two silks per thread, and is a combine that never fails. This will take your tailoring skill up to 15 with enough combines. Keep collecting silk and making threads until you have reached this level. Then combine pairs of threads to make silk bandages, of which you will need three to attempt your handwraps. Bandages can take your skill up to 21. Three bandages combined will make handwraps - this may not succeed at first attempt, in which case you need to try again. The handwraps can be worn as gloves until you get your Ghulam gloves in Shadeweavers, if you haven't already. Trivial for handwraps is at least 26.

If you have access to Crescent Reach or Abysmal Sea, you can do the tradeskill quests there to boost your skills to 54. It's a good idea to do this before trying the handwraps, and will make a big difference.

You can also use practice points to raise your skill level to 21 in tailoring; however, I don't recommend this, because you will collect more than enough silks to raise your skill to 15 by making threads alone, and you will want to conserve practice points for later, much higher levels (for other tradeskills); or just do the tradeskill quests.

The next stage in the claws quest requires you to collect 2 young hopper claws (from young rockhoppers), and four scorpion legs to create forged fasteners; these come from Kagazz, outside the smithy, in the inner merchant area. Combine fasteners, claws and handwraps in the sewing kit to make your claws; trivial is supposed to be over 40, so this may need repeating - check the trade skills section below for ways to get your tailoring skill as high as possible before making the attempt. On failure, the handwraps are returned, so you only need to regather scorpion legs and young rockhopper claws. Warning: I have failed this combine eight time with a tailoring skill of 32, and succeeded on my first try with the same skill at a different time. Returning these claws to Poren along with your starter cloak, and you will get a cloak upgrade. Poren sends you to see Mahron Sood, who is outside near the bank, who in return sends you to Kery Miann, upstairs in the tailoring vendor. Kery in turn requires you to make 2 straps for your claws, which needs 2 high quality rockhopper hides; these drops from any rockhopper, including needle clawed rockhoppers, in Shadeweaver's Thicket. Skill required is somewhere over 41.

In case you don't already know, The Pit is the hunting area underneath and around Shar Vahl. To get into it, take either of the bridges leading out of Shar Vahl to their far sides. You can climb down the wall, moving from side to side, without falling in and hurting yourself.

In the pit, kill everything - hunting a single type of mob will lead to it being replaced by new spawns of mobs that you aren't hunting. So if something is in short supply, exterminate beetles, whose supply never runs dry. Xakra worms seem to be commonest around the south gate area; young rockhoppers around the north gate. Collect the no drop poison glands from whiptail scorpions first - as soon as you have 4, go up into Shar Vahl to give them to Spiritist Ragnar (in the alchemist store, next to the bank), who will give you basic padded cloth armor in return; sell any bits you don't need.

If you see a yellow named scorpion (Tailfang), avoid it at first, as it is tough, higher level than it looks, and can summon you to it when you run, something that normally only level 51+ mobs can do.

Collect scorpion carapaces - these are required for the tailoring quest later, and also for the earring quest from Dharr Nadim (-350, 100) in the southern trade slum.

It may also be worth collecting worm meat (from xakra worms) and handing in to the cooks in the palace; you get a small amount of money, and a wooden practice weapon (which you can sell) for four.

Also collect beetle eyes and xakra teeth (the latter for the fletching quest). I never managed to collect enough eyes to complete the quest, from one of the guards on the bridges (Khala Dun Bokh).

As soon as you reach level 5, go back to your guild and put one practice point into kick; put this on a hot button, and use it in combat whenever it becomes ready. 

## Whisperlings (Level 4 - 6)
**Objectives**: Frostweavers Shield, Scorpialis 
 There are a couple of relatively complicated quests based in the pit that round out your time hunting there, and bring you into Shadeweavers, both revolving around whisperlings. Running around the pit, you may have noticed 'a whisperling casts a spell' as you pass by an illuminated stone just west of the south bridge.

You should talk to the following people: Dar Khura Shavra (in the pit, south edge), Groo McManus (Shadeweavers, in building near the Shar Vahl exit); Spiritist Ragnar (shop next to bank); Spiritist Grawleh (shaman guild in palace). After talking to the first two, you will be able to find the whisperling; take it to Dar Khura Shavra for instructions. You will also want a bloodling carapace along the way, and many of the intermediate items you are given are no rent, and will be lost if you camp without completing this quest series. At the end, you will have a special carapace, that can be used in one of Master Barkhem's shield frames to make a Frostweaver's Shield. This is a very worthwhile quest for Beastlords and shamans, as along the way rewards are the spells scrolls for Strengthen, Flash of Light, and Endure Cold; you can also get Burst of Flame (shaman, not beastlord) by giving a needle-thin claw from rockhoppers to Groo McManus in Shadeweavers.

You are also given a hint that Scorpialis is the name of another whisperling; which is also the name of the weapon you get from killing Tailfang and taking the tail to Dar Khura Pyjek, in the pit under the south bridge.

Another hint you are given is that there may be an upgrade to the shield possible by hunting Shak Dratha; to the best of my knowledge, this hasn't yet been completed - the Xakra shield mentioned by Rawleh may drop from guards at the Shak Dratha camp near the trader cave entrance. 

## Back in the Shade (Levels 5 - 8) 
**Objectives**: Ghulam boots, claws upgrade(, Hunting boots) 

 By this time you will be level 4 or 5, and the newbie area mobs will have started to turn green. This is time to move out to Shadeweavers Thicket and on to lesser shades, skeletal hunters, swarmers and saurek hoppers, which will mainly be found, as well as some higher level mobs, to the north of the tents and merchants. Collect shadowed claws from the lesser shades for another piece of ghulam armor from Kaza Raj.

It may be worthwhile saving claws and scales from all the various saurek types for some other quest armor items and weapons - but I didn't find them any better than the basic Ghulam armor. See Captain Tarief for the scales and Hunting Leather items. There is also a quest series involving collecting jawbones from shades and other skeletons; talk to Spiritist Karina; these also aren't any better than Ghulam, and the jawbones are very rare.

By this time you should have collected a few high quality hopper hides; these are used in the next stage of the claws quest. If you haven't already, deliver the seal given to you by Poren to Mahron Sood, near the bank, and in turn deliver his map to Kery Miann, upstairs in the tailoring vendor. Use the stone blade she gives you to cut 2 straps from HQ hides (tailoring skill trivial is ??); give them to her with your claws, and you are given new claws, plus a note for Hollowshade that won't be worth delivering until you reach level 15.

Round about level 7, gaining experience starts to slow; you don't have the additional skills to make combat with whites and yellows easy any more, and fighting dark blues will become tougher - and you will notice that these are becoming scarcer, until the brigands and thugs are feasible targets. If so, see my comments about Paludal for a quick boost to your levels. 

## Warder and Spells Strategy (level 9)
 By the time that lesser shades start to turn green, and skeletal hunters light blue, you should have reached level 9 and your warder. Your warder is summoned by casting the appropriate warder level buff spell (at 9, Spirit of Sharik).

As soon as you get your warder, return to your guild and put one training point in each of the magic skills (six of them), and purchase spells. You will want Spirit of Sharik, and Inner Fire; the others aren't essential at this level. Note that Flash of Light is not available in Shar Vahl from the spell vendors, you have to do the whisperling quest to get get it; the closest other point to obtain it is from the Cleric guild in Shadowhaven, which is not reachable without assistance until your mid-twenties. Flash of Light is the next spell to obtain, but not absolutely essential. The other spells are worth having, but not if you are short of money. Cure Disease is available at level 9, and doesn't show up on all spell lists - this is essential if you are going to Paludal to cure Creeping Crud from the fiends. Use the pet window, and learn the following commands effects: /pet attack, /pet guard here, /pet follow me and /pet back off. You may want to drag these off the panel to make hot buttons. I don't disable taunting with a beastlord pet (I do with shadow knight pets only), as their taunting can be valuable to help pull a mob off another group member at times. One command that is missing from the pet panel that you should put on a hot key is '/pet report health'. This tells you what buffs are active on your pet at any time, in case you miss the messages when buffs drop.

In Shadeweavers, all you will need do is cast your pet and buff it, then run around and let it assist you in any fights. You will find it hits for more damage if it hits from the back of a mob, so try to maneuvre round in any fights for best position. More advanced strategies will come into play in Paludal and Hollowshade, where there is less safe room to skirmish. Always cast Inner Fire on your pet, plus the proc buff Spirit of Lightning when you have it (at 15). I haven't noticed Strength making a difference on my warder. At this level, don't bother to practice your casting skills, as until you get meditate (at level 12), the process of training takes too long; you will not run short of mana at this point, so just treat it as a useful bonus when you remember to cast. Note that I didn't recommend collecting either healing spell (self or pet) as a priority - this is because Inner Fire has a better healing effect on you, and your pet regenerates very rapidly - and if your pet is that low in combat that healing is required, you are better off to step in and melee to take the hits yourself. Both Inner Fire and Minor Healing cost 10 mana to cast; Inner Fire is slower, but heals for 20 hit points, whereas Minor Healing only heals for 10. 

## Bandits and Warders (Level 8 - 14)
**Objectives**: Ghulam Bracers, Sleeves, Cap and Pants, Talisman of the Flame, Hero's Shroud

As soon as you reach 10, go and train one point in dodge; then at 12, in meditate.

Once skeletal brigands and Loda Kai brigands turn dark blue, it is time to earn the rest of your Ghulam armor. Brigands of both types will drop skulls, and live brigands also drop earrings; collect four of each. Thugs drop insignia, and are slightly higher level than most brigands. Any Loda Kai can drop the rather rare remains, which should be collected for another quest, for the Talisman of Flame (see Hymnist Omiyad). The live Loda Kai will also give you your first experience of getting money from a kill. On a recent check, the drop rate of the bandit earring seemed lower than I remembered - I had dozens of skulls, several sets of remains, two sets of thug insignia and three of the four saurek fangs before I had one earring, and it took three play sessions to get the set of four. Collect two extra earrings to wear; these have +10 hit points, which is a good stat to have for the level at which you can obtain them.

All of these, and poachers too, can be found most frequently in the area of land between the Gor Taku camp (just follow the path from the crossroads sentry to the West), the skeletal brigand camp (further northwest from there), and some point roughly half way from that base line northwards towards the Paludal entrance.

By the time that you are happy to pull brigands and thugs from the skeletal camp, poachers will also be good hunting. These are found most commonly in the valley between the brigand camp and the entrance to the trader cave (towards the Gor Taku camp), and on the higher ground just north of this. From poachers, collect poached hides for the Champions Cape quest, and ruined cat pelts should you need any for tailoring. The weapons they drop should be given to beastlord newbies if at all possible, as they only sell for a couple of silver. Talk to Sentry Ferrin, near the zone entrance from Shar Vahl, to start the quest for the Hero's Shroud.

The last of the ghulam armor pieces come from collecting saurek fangs, which are dropped by saurek claw beasts (around level 14); you will need four. These spawn sometimes in the bandit camp, and can also be found in the north-south plain west of the path leading to the Paludal entrance. Bloodbulks are also in this area, but are extremely rare, as well as extremely tough, and don't often drop carapaces, which are for the ghulam tunic. I have heard that bloodbulks spawn in the cave system near the Paludal entrance, so if you are set on a tunic, try killing bugs in here until they spawn - I haven't had a chance to verify this.

## Trader Cave (Level 14 - 16)
**Objective**: Blessed Champion's Cape
 At some point you will have a full set of Ghulam armor, apart from the tunic, with tattered rockhopper hide filling out all the gaps, and quite probably a hero's shroud on your shoulders from the poached hides. Now it is time to concentrate on the Champions Cape, which requires two more hero's shrouds, plus three Loda Kai blood. To get this, you will need to deal with the traders cave. Talk to Priestess Bast, in the rocks to the left of the Shar Vahl exit first.

There are two realistic strategies to cope with the cave, and some combination of these is probably best. First, if you attempt to pull anything at all from the cave while standing on the ledge - try casting flash of light or sicken on any mob near the ledge - you will get all of the poachers from the cave rushing you. If this isn't expected, you may need to zone into Shar Vahl, as the guards won't protect you from poachers (apparently now they will - this was fixed in a patch since I last ran a new beastlord through this guide). So you can tell your pet to guard here in the entrance tunnel, and pull the poachers to this point and dispatch them. At lower levels (you'll probably be attempting this from 12 - 14), you will need a group, with at least two others of similar levels; with your warder upgrade, this may be possible to solo pull at 15. The other strategy also requires a group, although it may be possible with just a shaman partner. As the mobs in the cave don't usually wander, if you can dispatch them one at a time quickly, you won't get others joining in - a shaman to keep them rooted is a very good idea. Make sure you brief the shaman well beforehand, as most shamans at this level still think that they are a melee class, and aren't mentally prepared enough to chain cast root - which they will need to do, as it will break a lot. Combining these two strategies to kill a couple of poachers first (if they are on the spawns closest to the ramp), then pull the remaining poachers to the foot of the ramp and take the traders one by one, should lead to you getting all the blood required, as well as any remaining hides, in a very brief time.

The practical alternative is to leave this quest until much later, and come back and let your warder solo all the mobs in the cave until you have enough drops. I was getting about one poached hide and one drop of blood per full clearing of the cave.

To make the Cape, you need to hand in a shroud to Kojjin Kaa to get a pattern; the shroud is given back. Combine two shrouds, the pattern, and one shadeling silk thread to get a Champions Cape; hand this in to Priestess Bast with three drops of Loda Kai blood. You can find them in the rocks behind the tents in Shadeweavers. The tailoring trivial for this is at least 26, possibly higher. I would skill up on silk threads, patchwork armor, and even shade silk armor, which can take you as high as 36.

## Hollowshade (Level 14/15 - 40)
**Objective**: Cloak of the Khati Shah Apprentice
 Hollowshade is much tougher than Shadeweavers; it isn't worth fighting in until level 15, and your pet upgrade. Mobs in Hollowshade are also undercons, and fighting blues here will be much harder for that reason, and so give poorer experience than is possible elsewhere. Your next quest stage will involve talking to Rittuh Purrik and collecting hopper tails; these are another uncommon drop. Make sure you also collect hides and hopper claws. Report back to Kery Miann, who will send you to collect a glowing muckdigger heart from Paludal - and head straight back into Hollowshade. Kery then sends you to Kaam Rahiir in the Library (-250, 130), the southern set of buildings outside of the main palace.

In front of the outpost rhinobeetles and rockhoppers pass by frequently; the guards will protect you from these, so tell your pet to guard here about half way from the gates to the path, and pull to your pet.

Behind the outpost, in the palms and up the ridge, you should normally find owlbears; mostly cubs, but some much tougher. If the war is in progress, these may be replaced by sonic wolves or grimlings; I only met owlbears there on two days ever with my first beastlord (while levelling slowly and carefully), and grimlings the rest of the time. These can be pulled back towards the outpost, but be careful of the guards, who may pass through the outpost walls to KS you. The guards don't seem to attack owlbears, however, although I can't be certain of this.

There are two higher level (about 25 - 30) mobs that roam in this area, and are highly aggressive: Dirtchomp, a giant rockhopper, and Gorehorn, a giant beetle. Keep well clear at this stage; they are magic resistant as well as tough. Now that the Hollowshade War has been fixed, Dirtchomp at least seems to be lower in level than he used to be (dark blue to 35), and much less magic resistant - I didn't have any problem slowing, dotting and nuking him at 35, and killed him solo.

Your mission from Kaam is to collect two molars from sonic wolf cubs; later stages of the beastlord and tailoring quests will require owlbear and sonic wolf parts - these won't be possible to collect if the war is stuck, or if players are using it to farm items. To reach the sonic wolf sector of the zone, just follow the path. There should be a cub or wolfling in the area between the two streams, with few or none of the higher wolfs, so this should be a good area to hunt. The area north of the wolf cave before the Grimling Forest zone should also have cubs and wolflings as well as higher level wolves. Be warned that molars were a rare drop; but I got two of them in three kills in the fixed Hollowshade.

Handing in the two molars starts the sonic wolf bane weapons portion of the quest. By the stage you already have your upgraded cloak, and this item won't get another upgrade until you have moved into Grimling Forest many levels later - at which point it is a very nice cloak indeed. If you want to progress in the quest, you should try to find two tiny owlbear claws, which should drop from owlbear cubs and grapplers, in the area east of the owlbear caves but before the first bridge. These claws are very rare indeed; it took me several days of farming to find them. The claws have to go to Jhimis Khadwi, the jeweller at 310, -370 in Shar Vahl, which is the middle merchant building in the north of the central area. Jhimis will give you the stretching dowels required to make the sonic wolf bane components required from beastlords. I'll leave the weapons quest at this point, as the next stage will require 135 tailoring skill, which won't be feasible until you can clear out the main owlbear caves safely; by this time you will be at least level 39.

As you reach 17, return to your guild and train one point in dual wield.

You will want to come back to Hollowshade later, to exploit the drops you can get from the Hollowshade War, and to continue with the sonic wolf bane quest, leading to the officers cloak. If you are alone, leave this until you reach 49, although it can be attempted earlier; with a group or two, come back at 39 instead. 

## Warder and Spells Strategy (level 15)
 As you reach 15, a new set of spells is available to you - return to your guild and get them. As well as any old spells from level 9 that you haven't yet purchased, you will want Spirit of Khaliz, Spirit of Lightning, Blast of Frost, Sicken, Scale Skin, Strengthen, and Fleeting Fury; the others are less useful. You won't be able to find Sense Animals, which is available from Ranger/Druid guilds, but fortunately also from Gadallion, one of the gypsies in Oasis; this is a very useful spell, but only really in outdoor zones when you are farming pelts! You don't really need Sense Animals; when you tell your warder to guard, he will automatically turn to face the closest mob. Note that you can buy a stack of snake scales from Ragnar's shop to power Scale Skin. It is now going to be worth your while practicing casting to max your skills; use the lowest level spell in each group that you can cast, and cast on a corpse - it is worth finding one just to practice on. Use at least a full charge of mana at each level; improving skills will reduce fizzles, and make you more effective.

To attack using your new spells, make sure first that your pet (level 16, and yellow to you!) has Spirit of Khaliz, Spirit of Lightning, and Inner Fire; Strengthen may or may not have a beneficial effect. You should have Inner Fire, possibly Scale Skin, and Strengthen. Cast Fleeting Fury on your pet immediately before pulling, or while the mob is incoming; Fleeting Fury has the effect of making your pet proc more often. Pull using Sicken, and step back to cast Blast of Frost a few times once your pet is taking the mobs aggro. This hardly makes much difference at this stage, but will be extremely good practice for later levels, as well as keep your evocation skill up. If you let your pet do much tanking for you, and this is an excellent idea at levels 15 and 16, keep a close eye on health, and be prepared to heal if necessary.

In an outdoor zone with roaming mobs, it is generally acceptable to run up to a mob and start fighting, expecting your pet to join in, or even to tell your pet to attack while you hold back for a last minute cast of Fleeting Fury, or to place a dot. However, in some zones this will leave you in the path of roaming mobs, and so is not good practice. For static mobs, and dungeons, this will get you killed quickly. Instead, find a good spot free of mobs and wanderers not too far from those you want to hunt, and tell your pet to guard a few feet back from where you want to fight. This is because your pet will rush forward when you take damage, if you are close enough. It will take a little practice to find out what distances work best. Pull with Sicken if possible; this does very minor damage, but the disease counter hinders normal regeneration while it is active (I believe).

If you find that your pet doesn't return to his guard spot, here's a tip from the EQBeastlord forums; tell him to sit first, then to guard. After that, he will almost always return to the same spot.

When both you and your pet are in melee range, mobs will only attack you (this applies to any player). I have only ever seen pets take aggro when a mage pet is fighting alongside our pet (this may apply to necromancer pets as well, but I haven't had the opportunity to find out). Unless you are below the magic 20 - 30% hit points level, or have done something else to increase aggro, aggro will normally stay with your pet as you move back. During the course of a fight, manage the damage that both you and your pet are taking by moving in and out of melee range. Back off and heal yourself at a suitable level - depending on mana and other factors, I may set this at anywhere from 60 - 80% in good circumstances, or 40% in an emergency. Your pet will take a lot more damage when you aren't in melee, so if your pet is below 40%, heal your pet first. The pet heal spell is fast and heals for a reasonable amount (almost 30% for the level 16 pet), and has the added bonus of curing disease.

If you are fighting in Paludal, many mobs are positioned just outside the assist radius of each other, but are otherwise very tightly positioned. This means that if you pull them back to a safe spot, you will usually aggro several at a time, and will be in danger of getting adds from respawning. So instead, it can be a good idea to fight the mob in place; this applies to everywhere in Paludal apart from the bandit camps and fiends. Because most mobs don't run (exception: glowing muck diggers), by standing almost on top of the mob before causing aggro, it will be effectively locked in place when combat starts, and won't get any assists - for most spawn locations. 

## Warder and Spells Strategy (level 22)
At 19, you will have been able to get Serpent Sight and Tiny Companion (Plane of Knowledge only); neither of these are very useful, unless you often group with a human/erudite. At 22, you get a new pet (level 22), a proc buff (Spirit of the Blizzard), a stamina buff (increases your hit points as well as reduces fatigue, so essential), a better heal (still not as mana efficient as Inner Fire, but much faster), a dot upgrade (Tainted Breath) and your first slow (Drowsy). The remaining two spells are both useful, Summon Drink and Endure Poison, and by this point you should be able to afford them all. Practice a lot with Summon Drink, as it uses conjuration, which skill is required for your dots. Endure Disease will become available for you at level 24. The various pet proc buffs all cause your pet to proc a direct damage for increasing amounts (62 - 82 for the first 3 buffs) - but are based against different resists, and the higher buffs last for longer durations (40 to 44 minutes) and higher mana cost (50 - 70).

Always cast Drowsy on all mobs you will be meleeing, always. At first, you may have some trouble casting Tainted Breath unless you have been practising a lot, but Sicken should still be reliable to cast. I usually choose to pull with Drowsy at this point, but that assumes that Tainted Breath is a reliable cast; if it isn't, I'd probably swap the two around. In either case, I'd cast one to pull, and the second on incoming - for a marginal mob I need them slowed, and dotted as well if possible. Your nuke doesn't do much damage to mobs even at the start of this spell level, but it is good to cast to keep evocation skill practised.

Towards the end of this spell level, you will find that most dark blue mobs can whip you on your own, without your warder, and even with your warder, you will take a lot of damage. When this starts to happen, remember to back off before you get too low, and heal your warder. At 29, you should be able to solo white and yellow mobs by pulling with slow, dotting, and sending in your pet before they reach you. Then sit back and med, and chain cast Fleeting Fury and your pet heal; only step in when you are low on mana, and when the mob starts to run. Remember to step in for melee, otherwise you have no way of keeping combat skills up, and will regret this very much at later levels. 

## Paludal (Level 8 - 24)
**Objective**: experience!
 Paludal is a dungeon zone (with a hefty experience bonus, some say perhaps 35% - it is actually closer to 100% over normal hunting areas) that is very well laid out for Vah Shir starting from both Shadeweavers and Hollowshade entrances.

It is probably best to start at level 8, although 7 or even 6 is certainly possible, at the Shadeweavers entrance. To reach it, follow the path north from Shar Vahl, and drop into the cave; in there, take the first left turn, then the next two right turns. Beware of the diggers in there - they are tougher than the mobs inside Paludal, and are both aggressive and social. So just run by them without stopping, making full use of the tunnel sides to stay out of reach. Inside Paludal you will find a series of mud burrowers and mud diggers; these too are social, but they are not aggressive, and most of the spawns in the first tunnel can be taken one at a time - if you find you pull two, run to the zone to lose aggro, and zone straight back in. The first pond area has slightly higher level bugs and lower reishi, and includes a couple of reishi spawns - these hit a lot harder, but are non-social. If you are at the lower level range, some of the reishi will be dark blue and suitable, as well as those in the first tunnel to your right. Keep on going, but stop as soon as you see the fiends ahead in the next couple of pond areas. Moving up and down this corridor will take you to 12 with ease.

Solo, I normally start with the reishi at the pond, and stay on reishi in the right side corridor until 11. In a duo or group, chain kill the bugs as you go, as you can easily handle the adds, and need the larger total pool of mobs to kill.

When too many of the mobs are light blue, so that you can't continually move from one dark blue to the next, it is time to try the Hollowshade entrance. Go back through Shadeweavers and Shar Vahl into Hollowshade; be very careful there, as mobs are social and aggressive, and much higher level. Run straight south along the higher zone sides to the lake. There you will see a cave entrance at the west extreme of the lake, with a short tunnel leading to the Paludal zone line. You will need to swim a short distance to climb onto the rocks leading into the cave; run in and zone if you have collected a train of beetles.

The first tunnel here is very profitable for experience at this level, and full of muck diggers and some grime tunnelers with a single, slightly tougher, reishi. Glowing muck diggers are tougher (about level 14) and much more social, but will drop a glowing heart stone for the latest stage of your beastlord cloak quest; you can do this at 14, or with ease at 15. Be warned that glowing muck diggers run when low, which can cause a lot of adds. The normal muck digger hearts are for a shaman quest. Move up and down this passage until they turn light blue (probably around 16). This passage can support two small groups, although it is also popular with power levellers, unfortunately.

Next, move to the end of the passage in sight of the fiends. All will be dark blue. Some can be easily single pulled, although you will get twos and threes at times. Work out which points will do which - the obvious single pull is the one to the right of the entrance, but the two on rocky points can also be single pulled, provided they are dealt with in order. The fiend to the left will usually bring three at a time. Fiends will get you to 18 easily and quickly, and they drop some reasonable loot. Fiends also give you Creeping Crud, which lasts for 90 minutes, and does enough damage to counteract your normal hit points regeneration while it lasts. For this reason, use Cure Disease (level 9 spell) at the end of fights, and remember that your pet heal spells also cure disease on your warder.

As you reach 17, you will gain dual wield; remember to carry and equip a second weapon!

When too many are light blue, it is time to move into the next corridor beyond the fiends. If you use sneak and stay high on the walls, it is unlikely that they will attack. Remember to con a test fiend before moving; if you are behind it and it is indifferent, then your sneak is working. In this corridor, there are grime tunnelers, sediment delvers, and more reishi. The bugs are mostly too close together to safely single pull, plus there are wanderers that can make a safe single into three or more. For this reason, the reishi are a better target. A duo can fight reishi in a continual stream with no downtime from 20 - 24 with ease. There is a single outcast shiknar to the right that will aggro; it also double hits, so take care; until you have levelled up a couple of times it may do enough damage to cause you to take extra downtime for healing and meditation, although you will be able to take it as a dark blue easily. Be careful exactly where you sit - there are a couple of points here where sitting against the tunnel wall will aggro one of the adjacent shiknar.

If you get bored with this group of reishi, move along the corridors killing shiknar; you will eventually end up at the Reishicyben. Collect Shiknar legs and bile (which stack) and carapaces, as these fetch the best cash; a single trip can easily pay you 20 platinum. Shiknar will turn light blue as you reach 23/24, but the reishi will still turn up as dark blue a reasonable proportion of the time. By the time you reach 22, you can get probably slightly faster experience from the higher level fiends around the large lake close by the Shadowhaven entrance and the bandit camps. At this point, you will be able to walk in front of plerg fiends with immunity, but patog fiends, in the inner caves, will still aggro unless you sneak, so a trip to Shadowhaven becomes feasible as you reach 24. They will stop aggroing on you when you reach level 30.

During your time in Paludal you will need to leave to sell up, and will want to spend time in Shadeweavers and Hollowshade to complete your class quests; it makes a pleasant change to be able to alternate between zones, at some times concentrating on quests, and at other times on levelling. Remember that it is more satisfying to do the quests in Shadeweavers and Hollowshade at a point when you still get experience from killing the quest mobs. Check my notes for the other zones to see when you should be training new skills - but block should be gained at 25, which I don't think is mentioned elsewhere. 

## Moving On
This guide so far takes you through the native Vah Shir zones to 24, using just one possibly pattern of hunting. It is possible to stay hunting in Shadeweavers to 20 or more, on the west side of the central ridge and in the caves; and it is perfectly possibly to hunt well in Hollowshade to 35. However, I don't believe that these are efficient places to gather experience, and this guide so far has shown you really all of the good native hunting areas for Vah Shir.

For higher levels, starting at 24, there are several good choices, and no single path can really be said to be the best. At 24 it is possible to hunt in Echo Caverns, Netherbian Lair, or Marus Seru; each has its advantages and disadvantages. My preference at this level is for Echo Caverns. I chose to roam to Sanctus Seru and Katta to perform the Eye of Trust and Earring of Veracity (1 and 2) quests during these levels; the Amulet of the Haven faction quest for Shadowhaven is also a must (less so than for non-Luclin races).

From 22 to 32 (roughly), both Marus Seru and Netherbian Lair are popular hunting locations - neither of which I enjoyed at all. Marus Seru has some good features: it is a wide open zone and most mobs don't aggro, although they are social and will assist others of their kind. Zelniaks and lightcrawlers here will aggro, however. Greyhoppers in particular are easy kills, and drop greyhopper hides (and rockhopper hides), which can take your tailoring skills to 95 easily, and is the simplest way of skilling up for the Vah Shir tailoring quest. Stonegrabbers rarely drop some valuable items (iron oxide, sell it in the Bazaar), although in general I would describe it as a poor zone for loot.

Mobs in Netherbian are social, hit hard, and regen fast. But they drop good cash, and a couple of named mobs drop good loot - the Netherbian Chitin drops from the Swarm Leader, for instance, and the soiled breechclout from the Trog King. However, he is only just about soloable at 30, and would be tough earlier than that solo. Most groups set up at the central pillar to pull netherbians, although each of the holes in the passageway can be profitable pull spots. Trogs are the only mobs that don't aggro initially, so you can safely explore their tunnels to get a feel for the area. This zone is a lot safer for rooting casters than it is for beastlords, especially ones who can dot to death their mobs and safely root adds.

In Netherbian Lair, you will sometimes see a human standing by the exit to Dawnshroud, called Lerin Sardor. If you are willing to escort him to the Nexus, he will reward you with a nice earring (wis +3 and various other stats). At these levels you will need a group to do this, but at higher levels you can easily do this quest solo. Once you have negotiated an agreement with Lerin, he will start walking towards the Nexus; he is going to be intercepted 3 (possibly 4) times by groups of mobs coming out of the tunnels; starting with 2 fungal sporelings, and finishing with 5 Netherbians at the central pillar. The trick to winning is to have your toughest available tanks (probably yourself) stand on top of Lerin whenever he is attacked. Let your warder and/or group kill the attackers. They will concentrate on you, and will ignore Lerin so long as you are in their melee range. Keep Lerin targeted if you can, in case he needs a heal - a cleric/druid/shaman can handle this much better than a bestlord in case of emergencies.

From 27, I would recommend Dawnshroud Peaks. Starting with shroom, either solo or in a small group, then moving on to tribals, this is a very effective way to get to 35 with good loot. By moving targets within the zone, it is perfectly possible to reach 42 here, and return at higher levels to deal with rockhoppers.

At higher levels still, in the 40s, you will have a choice of several Luclin zones. Dawnshroud continues to be a staple with tribals, rockhoppers and stonegrabbers still good. The high side of Echo Caverns also works well, certainly from the 39 pet upwards, and at the same time Tenebrous Mountains is a possibility. Scarlet Desert and Mons Letalis are two other zones that I have only investigated a little as yet, but should apply in this range.

## Author's Notes

### My Motives and Excuses

The Vah Shir have one of the best starting areas and newbie quest series in the game, and yet I often used to see (pre-Planes of Power) level 1 newbies asking for ports off Luclin; this could only be, I felt, the result of a profound ignorance of the area, and a fear of this ignorance being discovered, as well as revealing a reluctance to play Everquest in the (semi) roleplaying way that seems to suit it best. I believe that there is an excellent sequence of zones and quests suitable for a Vah Shir beastlord, one that gives the best experience in the game for any race/class combination, with very appropriate quests and above average gear. There are still some bugs in the quest sequence, but the bugs in the Vah Shir quests are not too disruptive (at the young levels). All of the newbie quests suffer from keeping you hunting greens for far too long; the Vah Shir may have you do this less than others. 

### My Beastlord Bio

I made my first beastlord and first Vah Shir on Bristlebane around May, 2002; only my third ever Everquest character. I leveled him to 32, mainly in the company of my wife's first character, a Vah Shir shaman, before writing the first draft of this guide on holiday in Hawaii in June 2002, entirely from memory and my notes (no web access). I had already seen guides for other beastlord races on the EQ Beastlords site, but no Vah Shir guide, and felt that the unique situation of Shar Vahl lent itself to a roleplayer's guide to the class. I took up to September to review and rewrite the guide, which at that point went up to level 24 only. In December 2002, I created a new Vah Shir beastlord on a different server, Venril Sathir, and leveled him up to 24 over three days elapsed time with 24 hours played to review the guide, and noticed quite a few minor changes that I needed to adjust for. By June 2003, he had leveled to 52, with only just over 10 days played time, by way of helping me write the then current draft that extended my detailed outline up to that level. By September 2003, he had reached 61 with 10 AAs, Coldain Prayer Shawl 5, Officers Cloak, and 20 days played. As of September 2004, he is level 65 (for some time) with epic and 100+ AAs. 

### What's Missing?

I am conscious that the levelling guide could be expanded; this will always be true. I haven't explicitly covered anything to do with the most recent expansions: GoD, OoW, DoN, PoR and TSS; they don't have much impact on these lower levels. There are spells, armor, augments and other aspects from these expansions that I have ignored. I will have to expand some sections to cover starting in Crescent Reach as an alternative, and all the armor quest series available there. Some aspects are best covered elsewhere: so for gear choices, I have linked to a thread on www.beastlords.org; and my AA coverage describes starting choices only.

Since I last updated this, the Tutorial zone has been expanded to cover up to level 10 and use the task system; spells have been reallocated to be every level, and new tradeskill based armor quests have been added (DoN). Why so slow on updates? Because, like many Everquest players, I have been playing World of Warcraft since February 2005 (European release date), with a level 60 hunter, rogue, warlock and (soon) warrior. I haven't completely given up on Everquest, and intend to update this guide as things change while I still keep an account open.
