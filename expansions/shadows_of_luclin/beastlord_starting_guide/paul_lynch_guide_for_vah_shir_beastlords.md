# Guide for Vah Shir Beastlords

> **Original Author**: Paul Lynch  
> **Original Date**: August 9, 2005  
> **Note**: This guide has been preserved and converted to wiki.js format. It reflects EverQuest as it existed in 2005 and may contain outdated information regarding recent expansions and mechanics.

## Introduction

This guide is a comprehensive resource for a new Vah Shir beastlord. Rather than providing detailed walkthroughs of every quest, it points you toward useful starting places and highlights rewards. This guide assumes you're interested in playing a Vah Shir because of the race itself and a beastlord because of the class—meaning you'll be inclined to engage in some roleplay (which is exactly zero by default in most players!).

### Why Vah Shir?

The Vah Shir have one of the best starting areas and newbie quest series in the game. They also have significant leveling advantages:

- **Fast teen-level progression**: The Vah Shir's proximity to Paludal Caverns allows progression from level 6 to 24 very rapidly, thanks to experience bonuses in the area. Most players only know Paludal for the bandit camps near Shadowhaven, but the Shadeweavers and Hollowshade entrances offer smooth progression.
  
- **Excellent solo capability**: Beastlords can confidently solo at higher levels than many classes, taking on whites or several dark blues—often even yellows. Solo viability extends into the thirties and forties, with grouping becoming faster at higher levels.

- **Limited loot economy**: Money is scarce in Vah Shir areas compared to other zones. Players accustomed to generous loot elsewhere will notice the difference. However, resource management is learnable, and funds will accumulate sufficiently. Shamans feel the pinch most (expensive spells), but beastlords should encounter no financial hardship.

### About This Guide

This guide focuses on Vah Shir beastlords specifically, though much applies to other Vah Shir classes. The author has run a beastlord and bard there, plus received extensive input from a Vah Shir shaman.

**Note**: This guide does not provide detailed walkthroughs or tell you how to play EverQuest. If you want to powerlevel and twink, that's up to you, but much of this guide won't interest you. If you're still reading, you've made a good choice!

## Author's Notes

### My Motives and Excuses

The Vah Shir have excellent starting areas and newbie quests, yet level 1 newbies were often seen asking for ports off Luclin—suggesting profound ignorance of the area and reluctance to play EverQuest in a semi-roleplay style. The author believes the Vah Shir beastlord sequence offers the best experience in the game for any race/class combination, with appropriate quests and above-average gear.

While some bugs exist in the quest sequence, they're not overly disruptive at low levels. A minor downside: all newbie quests keep you hunting green mobs for too long, though Vah Shir quests may do this less than others.

### My Beastlord Bio

The author created their first beastlord and first Vah Shir on Bristlebane around May 2002, leveling to 32 alongside their wife's Vah Shir shaman. The first draft was written entirely from memory in June 2002 while on holiday in Hawaii (no web access). After reviewing and rewriting through September 2002, the guide initially covered only up to level 24.

In December 2002, a second Vah Shir beastlord was created on Venril Sathir and leveled to 24 in three days of elapsed time (24 hours played) to review the guide. By June 2003, this character had reached level 52 with just over 10 days played time. By September 2003: level 61 with 10 AAs, Coldain Prayer Shawl 5, Officer's Cloak, and 20 days played. As of September 2004: level 65 (for some time) with epic and 100+ AAs.

### What's Missing?

The leveling guide could be expanded further. The guide doesn't explicitly cover the most recent expansions (at time of writing): GoD, OoW, DoN, PoR, and TSS—they don't significantly impact lower levels. Expansion-specific spells, armor, and augments are largely ignored.

Future expansions should include:
- Starting in Crescent Reach as an alternative
- All armor quest series available there
- Updated sections to reflect new content

The Tutorial zone was expanded to cover level 10 using the task system. Spells were reallocated to be available every level, and new tradeskill-based armor quests were added (DoN).

**Update Status**: The author has been playing World of Warcraft since February 2005 (European release) but intends to continue updating this guide as EverQuest changes while maintaining an active account.
