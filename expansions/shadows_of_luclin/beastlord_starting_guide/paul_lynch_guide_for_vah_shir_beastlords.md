# Guide for Vah Shir Beastlords

## Introduction
This guide is a comprehensive guide for a new Vah Shir beastlord. I don't tell you how to play Everquest, and I don't give you detailed walkthroughs of any of the quests; but I will point you at useful places to start. My starting point is an assumption that you play a [Vah Shir](/character/races/vah-shir) because you are interested in the race, and a [Beastlord](/character/classes/beastlord) because the class interests you, and so will be inclined to "role play" a little more than the norm (which is exactly zero, btw). I'll take you through native Vah Shir hunting grounds as well as the game tutorial, and point out the quests and rewards. If you want to powerlevel and twink, that's up to you, but a lot of what I have to say won't be of any interest to you. If you are still interested in reading further, you've made a good choice! 

### Why Vah Shir?

The Vah Shir have one of the best starting areas and newbie quest series in the game. They also have significant leveling advantages:

- **Fast teen-level progression**: The Vah Shir also have the potential to progress through their teen levels faster than any other race, thanks to their proximity to Paludal Caverns. Most people know Paludal only for the bandit camps next to the Shadowhaven entrance, but the Shadeweavers and Hollowshade entrances can take you from 6 all the way up to 24 with a very smooth progression, and very rapidly thanks to the experience bonus Paludal offers. 
  
- **Limited loot economy**: Another important point is that money is very scarce in the Vah Shir areas, and players used to more generous loot elsewhere (plague rat tails dropping from level 1 rats, for instance) will be surprised. You have to learn to manage your resources intelligently, and sufficient money will come. Shamans, with expensive spells to purchase, will suffer the most, but there is no reason that a beastlord should feel any pinch. 

- **Excellent solo capability**: With most classes (druid and shaman, for example) when soloing I adopt a strict strategy of taking one blue at a time; with a beastlord, I can confidently take on a white, or several dark blues, and often yellows. Beastlords can solo with confidence, certainly well into their thirties and forties, and can make it to 65-75, although grouping becomes much faster as you hit the higher reaches.

### About This Guide

Because of the nature of the Vah Shir and their starting area, Shar Vahl, a lot of this information applies to other Vah Shir classes - but I have only run a [Beastlord](/character/classes/beastlord) there (well, and a [Bard](/character/classes/bard); and had a lot of input from a Vah Shir [Shaman](/character/classes/shaman)), so I can't entirely vouch for its accuracy for classes other than Beastlord.

## Creation
 I generally stick with the suggestions given on eq.castersrealm.com for new classes; so do as they advise and stick all your points into wisdom, as this directly affects your spell casting abilities once you get them, and will be the most beneficial at higher levels. Otherwise, you have no real choices that will affect your character in any meaningful way. The character creation screen suggest that stamina, agility, wisdom and charisma are all important for beastlords; which seems like very suspicious advice to me.

The above paragraph is all you need if you are in a hurry to get started, but if you need to know why, here is my explanation. For a caster class, you generally want them to have a large mana pool, which is done by increasing their wisdom attribute (or int, for int based casters). This can be done by starting points, or by equipment. Generally speaking, it is easy to raise wis, int and strength, far more so than other attributes, with equipment. For a melee class, strength is the primary attribute that influences how often they will hit for max damage. Charisma mainly has an effect only on vendor buying and selling prices, apart from bards and enchanters. Dexterity affects how rapidly melee skills increase, and how often a weapon procs, or casts it's special effect if it has one, and so is of specialised use. Stamina and agility are more interesting: they are hard to raise by gear, and stamina raises hit points, and agility raises armor class - but both have very much smaller impact for casters, rather more of one for melee and hybrid classes. These attributes, hit points and armor class, are easier to raise directly with equipment.

As a hybrid, both melee and casting attributes are important. Depending on how you will play your character, you can choose to favour one approach or the other. I can tell you that hybrids in a group rarely get a chance to meditate, so a large mana pool is more important than it may at first glance seem to be, and will generally get healed when required, so a large hit points total isn't vitally essential. For a soloer, and a beastlord is an excellent soloer, better melee stats are important, but then so is having a reasonable mana pool to minimise down time. At low levels, hit points matter more than anything else; at mid levels, a solo beastlord is likely to spend 1/3 of his time in combat meleeing, and 2/3 playing cleric for his warder; then at higher levels the solo beastlord will spend more and more time meleeing alongside their warder. However, beastlords can self buff all statistics apart from wisdom and agility; in a raid, agility will be buffed as well, and besides agility only has a minor impact on armor class. For this reason only, we should put points into wisdom at the start.

### Tutorial

You should really start by doing the tutorial, even if you are an experienced player.

### First Steps

Once your character is created, you will appear in the beastlord guild area in Shar Vahl (assuming that you took the choice to start in Shar Vahl - that's what this guide is about, after all). Before doing anything else, check your inventory, and read your starting note, which will tell you to give the note to your guildmaster. Do this, and you will be given the starting instructions for the citizenship quest that every Vah Shir has to pursue, and is required for most other training quests in Shar Vahl - and takes you straight to level 2 - or very close to it. While you are in front of your guildmaster, you might put five training points in your starting weapon skill, piercing (but if you have access to better weapons immediately, skip piercing and train in H2H or 1HB, as these are generally better all round or cheap weapon types for beastlords).

Outside is a room full of scribes selling shaman and beastlord spells, with a door to the left leading to the arena, and the warriors and rogues guilds; and to the right, a door leading to the main palace.

Feel free to explore Shar Vahl a little at first; you can use backspace or the "m" key to bring up a map of the city with key features marked. 

## The Mines of Gloomingdeep (Level 1-10/15)
 When you create your character, you have the option of starting in the Tutorial zone (the button that enables this is set on by default). You should do this, even if you are an experienced player, for several reasons. First, you get a charm with very nice statistics on it, as well as the possibility of getting some basic weapons, armor and some bags and even a little money for no cost. Secondly, when you leave you will be at least level 2, and anywhere up to level 15. Third, you can leave very well buffed, enough to give you a decent lift in your next hunting session. If you are a genuine beginner, then the knowledge imparted by running through the tutorial is excellent - which is why I will not repeat any of that here.

You start in the tutorial zone, Mines of Gloomingdeep. You have to run through the initial quest with Arias (Jail Break!) and the kobold jailer to enter the main mines zone. There is little to do here apart from follow instructions, and listen to (and read) some basic help information. That will put you at level 2. Take the Arias: Basic Training quest, and run through it to get the Kobold Skull charm. Take Arias: Rally with Rahtiz.

In the next zone, there will be other players - start by following the instructions to get the Kobold Skull Charm, which is a lot better than most charm drops in 50+ zones that you will reach without raiding - with one exception, that you can obtain in Crescent Reach at an early level. Along the way, Absor will upgrade your 3/24 newbie dagger to 3/22, gain a new spell called Salve (heals 5 hp for 10 mana), and an ac 2 Kobold Leather Mask. By this time, your charm has +5 wis, int, str, sta, and +10 hp and mana. Pozzik will give you an AC 2 Kobold Leather Mask, and his lost sword may also be a minor upgrade; he isn't part of the training quest, so watch out for him. Frizznik's baking is superceded by skill-up quests in Crescent Reach, but gives some very minor stat food (rat steaks, +5 hp). One probable bug: Rahtan used to refer melee characters to another NPC to get their level 1 tomes, but this no longer happens - they will have to buy them in PoK/Crescent Reach.

Now for some more useful information. Any time the buff runs out, return to Rytan and say "I want to be blessed" (this is a 97 hp buff).

Start with the rats and bats and spiders quests: Rahtiz: Clearing the Vermin Nests (stitched burlap leggings), Rebellion Reloaded (just exp, I think); and Vyrinn: Spider Caves, Spider Tamer Gugan. You should be able to clear all of these in 20-40 minutes, and be level 4/5; Gugan is level 5, and may be a little tough for his level. This leaves just the Arachnidia quest to kill Queen Gloomfang, who is level 7. Save this for later.

Run in and kill. Start with the spiders and rats, and loot anything they drop. Use /open (also in the Actions window) to open vermin nests, piles of bones, and barrels; you won't believe how hard they can be to open if you just attack them. Sell most items to the merchant, but keep the gloomingdeep silks and give them three at a time, unstacked, to Vahlara. She will give you some random stitched burlap armor, which is equivalent to cloth. Equip it, and sell spares to the merchant.

Stepping out to run the Plane of Knowledge quests at this point may be the best plan (see below). Back in the mines...

When you are level 4 or higher, move further in and kill kobolds; take the tasks from Guards Hobart and Maddoc. Hobart: Battle of Gloomingdeep; Maddoc: Kobold Leadership. Find Zajeer and Kaikachi while killing grunts and warriors. Stay with grunts at first, but move on to the warriors when you feel comfortable. A rare drop from these is a chunk of bronze, which is no drop. You can hand this in to Absor for an improved dagger (Bronze Gloomingdeep Dagger, 4/23). There are named kobolds, which often drop spells. While you are in the kobold area, open the barrels - some will gives you free small bags, and the forlorn bows sell for decent cash (1pp+ each).

Next find the two scouts in a side tunnel. Zajeer: Scouting Gloomingdeep, Sabotage; Kaikachi: Goblin Treachery, Busted Locks. Use the scouting task to get to the fort to execute Sabotage; the supplies crate is to the left as you enter; you will have to kill or pass 2 or 3 captains to do this. Come back to Zajeer and kill goblin slaves on the way. The locksmith is nearby, up the passage to the north. If you still need slaves and slave wardens, go into the pit - Rockfynn is along one of the side passages, and is level 7 (or 6).

Go back and kill Queen Gloomfang if you haven't already. Reward is a few celestial healing potions.

After this activity the only three quests remaining should be: Hobart: Freedom's Stand; and Maddoc: Pit Fiend. You can only get the latter after completing the Battle quest (may be level limited?), which also gives you some Gloomleather leggings. For Freedom's Stand you have to clear the fort, and kill the level 10 boss there, Overlord Grikan. When you succeed, check the area for lootable boxes which may have some nice items in. Grikan is probably the easiest of these three, and Hobart will give you a Gloomleather tunic for killing him. The pit fiend is a level 12 boss; he doesn't hit very hard, so a level 10 character with a damage shield potion should be able to take him. The final quest is Flutterwing's Dilemma from the main camp. Slavemaster Ruga, level 9, summons two guards when you attack him, so make sure to pull him away from his spawn point; you may be lucky and get him with no adds. I think he is harder than Krenshin (the pit fiend).

At this point I would switch to Crescent Reach, although it is certainly possible to spend all your time in one or the other. The value of Gloomingdeep is the charm, plus an easy way to get some very basic armor. Switching to Crescent Reach at this point lets you skip some grinding in Gloomingdeep, and pick up some much better armor. The old newbie quest armors are also better than the gloom armors, although how easy they are to obtain varies considerably with class and location (hint: all berserker quests are excessively easy). When you are ready to leave, remember to get a final buff from Rytan.

### Plane of Knowledge

There are two ways to leave the mines: through the doorway/tunnel into your home city (Crescent Reach), or by saying to Arias: "ready to leave". This takes you to the Plane of Knowledge. I would recommend the latter for some quick quest experience; take Arias's advice, and go to find Vivian the True, at the entrance to the Library. Her several small quests give significant exp at low levels. To get to Crescent Reach, go back into the tutorial from your character select screen.

You can stay in the Mines until level 15; at 16, you can no longer return. But you can't enter from the character select screen; the solution is to stay bound in the Mines, and use Gate (for casters only) to return. After level 10, the tutorial button on the character select screen is disabled. Up to 10, the Tutorial button is a quick way back to the Plane of Knowledge without a long run, or into Crescent Reach - also without a long run through Blightfire Moors.

Once you are level 10, some more quests become active in PoK; check with Vivian the True once more. She will send you to an armor quest NPC (one good, one evil), who I think will refuse to speak to people with a home in Crescent Reach (or Shar Vahl - they only speak to you if your home city and class has a newbie armor quest). She also gives a third, neutral quest giver: Castlen Drewe: Haunted Butcherblock, this requires level 11, and the reward is a Ghostly Mantle. Castlen has several quests to give, one per level up to 15/16, and a last one at 19. The armor NPCs give out pieces of the newbie quest armor, and if you have been levelling in Crescent Reach, this isn't likely to be an upgrade, although it is an improvement over the Gloomingdeep armors. Castlen's quests fill out most of the non-visible slots, and are high quality.

While in this level range and passing through PoK, get the Fine Antique Ring. Find Curator Merri in one of the buildings on the good side, and get her Collecting Box (just talk to her). Then you need to combine four items in it. A cockatrice beak, a high quality cougarskin, a tiny rockhopper eye, and an undead froglok tongue. You will need to buy the skin in the Bazaar (unless you are already 30ish!), so hold off on this quest until you can afford one; the alternative is a merchant diving trip to the gnomes in Iceclad to see if anyone has sold one to them (take the boat from North Ro). The other items can also be bought there; this will be cheaper for the beak than trying to hunt one, or buying one from a vendor. The tongue can be found from frogloks in Qeynos Catacombs near Cubert (fine if you aren't kill on sight there or can invis), and the eye from vendors in Shar Vahl, or from level 1 rockhoppers in the pit under the city. Tongues can also often be found on vendors in many other places. This ring has the mana preservation II focus. Also consider the mask quest (the Forgotten Pools) for spell haste II. This involves talking to the guys sitting next to the pools on the good side of PoK, and giving in a sarnak blood (Bazaar/merchants again, or a trip to the newbie yard area of Lake of Ill Omen, which isn't without its perils). You then need to make a run into Droga, so make sure that you have a good invis - the 10pp, instant cast cloudy potions may be an option for clerics and warriors, and make sure you take more than one. 

## Citizenship and Learning Shar Vahl (Level 1 - 2)
**Objectives**: Learn Shar Vahl, containers

One of the objectives of the citizenship quest is presumably to get you familiar with the layout of Shar Vahl; to cut this short, it helps to know that there is a basic symmetry to its plan - the palace in the centre (and to the west), a high class merchant area to the east of the palace with the arena at the far east, and slum/merchant areas to both the north and south of the central merchant area. From the north slum leads a bridge to Hollowshade, and from the south slum a bridge to Shadeweavers. At the far end of either bridge you can climb down into the pit underneath Shar Vahl.

Your guild leader has sent you to Registrar Bindarah, who is in a building adjacent to the south gate. She in turn will send you to the tax collector, in the bank in the central merchant district, and to Mignah, who is upstairs in a tavern next to the north gate. From there you return to Bindarah, who will send you to see King Raja in the palace, and then to return to your guild master. At this point the experience given from this quest may have made you level 2 already (this did the first time I ran it, but didn't the second).

If you need help finding these NPCs, try the Find button on your menus, or try asking the guards for directions.

While exploring Shar Vahl, you should start the basic trade skill quests appropriate for beastlords, all of which require you to hand over your citizenship slate. The beastlord claws quest starts in the beastlord guild, with Animist Poren (270, 50) once you have returned with your slate; you will be given your first container for this quest, the beastlord sewing kit. Beastlords should also do the tailoring quest, which starts with Broker Fahaar (225, -25) in the narrow corridor between the palace and the merchant district, and gives a container (you will need a total of 16 young rockhopper hides for this). There is also a fletching quest, which may or may not be useful for beastlords - see Rytan (-400, 400) in the south merchant area to start this, and which also gives you a container.

All these quests will have given you a long list of items to collect. Young rockhopper hides, which drop from young rockhoppers in the pit, xakra teeth from xakra worms in the pit, and shadeling silks from Xakra worms/larvae. You should also have a couple of containers to use to store all these items you must collect.

While you are exploring the city, you may notice a young Vah Shir female called Shainai walking around - hail her, and follow instructions. You should end up with a little money, plus a compass. With care, you can sell this compass for 2pp, by going to the right merchants. If you need money, this quest can be repeated, which is most easily done by waiting on the palace steps for Shainai to turn up.

Once you get bored with all this, which will happen very quickly, the question is, where to start hunting? You can start in the pit, or can go out into Shadeweavers; as the newbie area in Shadeweavers is slightly safer, and Shadeweavers, in contrast to Shar Vahl, is brightly lit, I prefer Shadeweavers to start. 

## First Hunting in Shadeweavers (Levels 2 - 3)
**Objectives**: Scavengers Pack, Ghulam gloves (, Bloodling Shield)
 Out in Shadeweavers, you will see a path leading between a few tents and buildings; all of this area is mostly safe, as far as the sentry at the crossroads; the best newbie hunting is to the left as you leave the city; the bank and two merchants are on the right.

Before doing anything else, find Faer Shahar and talk to him - if you collect four items of garbage, which appear throughout the zone, including on the path and in the newbie area, and give them to him, you will get a Scavengers Bag in return. Make this a priority if you don't have any other containers yet. The garbage looks like small sacks on the ground, and seem to take on the background coloration rather more than normal dropped items do. The garbage is no rent, which means that you must collect and hand in all four pieces in a single playing session, otherwise it will disappear when you log out.

The basic hunting strategy is to select a target and autoattack - no subtlety required. Guards will protect you from anything in the zone apart from Loda Kai poachers (apparently this was fixed in a patch, and the guards no longer have a non aggression pact with poachers). When you get your kick skill (at level 5 - it should appear automatically) put it on a hot key, and use it in combat every time it becomes available. It won't make much difference at the level you get it, but it is a valuable additional attack every three or four combat tics. Don't be afraid to die - below level 6, you lose nothing and respawn with all your items, and can often rush back into the fray and kill off whatever killed you.

Kill hoppers, worms and bloodlings, saving everything that they drop. You will need shadeling silk and hopperhides for tailoring, which is essential for your beastlord quest; needle claws are also useful for tailoring, and bloodling carapaces will be used for the shield quest. Rarely the bloodlings will also drop mandibles, of which you will need four. If you run short of room, put excess baggage into the bank, which is conveniently located in the zone. When you have enough mandibles, talk to Kaza Raj, close to the Shar Vahl entrance - he is the contact point for all of the Ghulam armor quests. If you stay longer in Shadeweavers and have magic weapons, you can also kill nuisances here; they drop cloth armor (usually just a cap) and a small amount of cash.

See the trade skills page for advice on how to tailor armor as an upgrade for you, using damaged rockhopper hides.

Turn in needle claws from the hoppers to the tailoring merchant, Tiamon Aroo; he will return you a single stackable needle for each set of four claws. He also will give you the best prices to sell your loot of the two in zone merchants. You can also discover how to make Shadowed Hopperhide armor from him - this is easy, fun, and looks cool; but is nowhere near as good as Ghulam armor, although it is a step up from basic tattered hopperhide armor.

Bloodling carapaces can be collected and combined in a special container, a shield frame, that you can buy from Master Barkhem, in the smith merchant in the NW of the merchant area; do not combine your collection of carapaces just yet, until you have completed the whisperling quest in the pit later, which gives you a slightly better shield.

Without money, you still have a free source of food and drink: you can forage payala berries under the trees by the merchants, and turn them in to one of the merchants for drink - which is also saleable for small amounts, and is an excellent source of faction for non-vah shir who wish to do Shar Vahl quests.

By now, you may have some things to sell; compare prices with the different merchants, as they vary considerably. The best price in Shadeweavers will be offered by Tiamon Aroo (of the two merchants); in Shar Vahl, Chiale at the city end of the south bridge is always good, and Gherik Alarhun in the pottery merchant in the inner area may have even better prices for some items. 

## The Pit (Levels 2 - 6)
**Objectives**: Beastlord handwraps and claws, Cloak of the Khati Sha Recruit, padded cloth armor, Kick 

 Your first objective will be to make your starting claw wraps, as directed by Poren. Assuming that your tailoring skill is high enough, this will take 12 silks from xakra worms; some you will have collected already. Combining silks into threads takes two silks per thread, and is a combine that never fails. This will take your tailoring skill up to 15 with enough combines. Keep collecting silk and making threads until you have reached this level. Then combine pairs of threads to make silk bandages, of which you will need three to attempt your handwraps. Bandages can take your skill up to 21. Three bandages combined will make handwraps - this may not succeed at first attempt, in which case you need to try again. The handwraps can be worn as gloves until you get your Ghulam gloves in Shadeweavers, if you haven't already. Trivial for handwraps is at least 26.

If you have access to Crescent Reach or Abysmal Sea, you can do the tradeskill quests there to boost your skills to 54. It's a good idea to do this before trying the handwraps, and will make a big difference.

You can also use practice points to raise your skill level to 21 in tailoring; however, I don't recommend this, because you will collect more than enough silks to raise your skill to 15 by making threads alone, and you will want to conserve practice points for later, much higher levels (for other tradeskills); or just do the tradeskill quests.

The next stage in the claws quest requires you to collect 2 young hopper claws (from young rockhoppers), and four scorpion legs to create forged fasteners; these come from Kagazz, outside the smithy, in the inner merchant area. Combine fasteners, claws and handwraps in the sewing kit to make your claws; trivial is supposed to be over 40, so this may need repeating - check the trade skills section below for ways to get your tailoring skill as high as possible before making the attempt. On failure, the handwraps are returned, so you only need to regather scorpion legs and young rockhopper claws. Warning: I have failed this combine eight time with a tailoring skill of 32, and succeeded on my first try with the same skill at a different time. Returning these claws to Poren along with your starter cloak, and you will get a cloak upgrade. Poren sends you to see Mahron Sood, who is outside near the bank, who in return sends you to Kery Miann, upstairs in the tailoring vendor. Kery in turn requires you to make 2 straps for your claws, which needs 2 high quality rockhopper hides; these drops from any rockhopper, including needle clawed rockhoppers, in Shadeweaver's Thicket. Skill required is somewhere over 41.

In case you don't already know, The Pit is the hunting area underneath and around Shar Vahl. To get into it, take either of the bridges leading out of Shar Vahl to their far sides. You can climb down the wall, moving from side to side, without falling in and hurting yourself.

In the pit, kill everything - hunting a single type of mob will lead to it being replaced by new spawns of mobs that you aren't hunting. So if something is in short supply, exterminate beetles, whose supply never runs dry. Xakra worms seem to be commonest around the south gate area; young rockhoppers around the north gate. Collect the no drop poison glands from whiptail scorpions first - as soon as you have 4, go up into Shar Vahl to give them to Spiritist Ragnar (in the alchemist store, next to the bank), who will give you basic padded cloth armor in return; sell any bits you don't need.

If you see a yellow named scorpion (Tailfang), avoid it at first, as it is tough, higher level than it looks, and can summon you to it when you run, something that normally only level 51+ mobs can do.

Collect scorpion carapaces - these are required for the tailoring quest later, and also for the earring quest from Dharr Nadim (-350, 100) in the southern trade slum.

It may also be worth collecting worm meat (from xakra worms) and handing in to the cooks in the palace; you get a small amount of money, and a wooden practice weapon (which you can sell) for four.

Also collect beetle eyes and xakra teeth (the latter for the fletching quest). I never managed to collect enough eyes to complete the quest, from one of the guards on the bridges (Khala Dun Bokh).

As soon as you reach level 5, go back to your guild and put one practice point into kick; put this on a hot button, and use it in combat whenever it becomes ready. 

## Whisperlings (Level 4 - 6)
**Objectives**: Frostweavers Shield, Scorpialis 
 There are a couple of relatively complicated quests based in the pit that round out your time hunting there, and bring you into Shadeweavers, both revolving around whisperlings. Running around the pit, you may have noticed 'a whisperling casts a spell' as you pass by an illuminated stone just west of the south bridge.

You should talk to the following people: Dar Khura Shavra (in the pit, south edge), Groo McManus (Shadeweavers, in building near the Shar Vahl exit); Spiritist Ragnar (shop next to bank); Spiritist Grawleh (shaman guild in palace). After talking to the first two, you will be able to find the whisperling; take it to Dar Khura Shavra for instructions. You will also want a bloodling carapace along the way, and many of the intermediate items you are given are no rent, and will be lost if you camp without completing this quest series. At the end, you will have a special carapace, that can be used in one of Master Barkhem's shield frames to make a Frostweaver's Shield. This is a very worthwhile quest for Beastlords and shamans, as along the way rewards are the spells scrolls for Strengthen, Flash of Light, and Endure Cold; you can also get Burst of Flame (shaman, not beastlord) by giving a needle-thin claw from rockhoppers to Groo McManus in Shadeweavers.

You are also given a hint that Scorpialis is the name of another whisperling; which is also the name of the weapon you get from killing Tailfang and taking the tail to Dar Khura Pyjek, in the pit under the south bridge.

Another hint you are given is that there may be an upgrade to the shield possible by hunting Shak Dratha; to the best of my knowledge, this hasn't yet been completed - the Xakra shield mentioned by Rawleh may drop from guards at the Shak Dratha camp near the trader cave entrance. 

## Back in the Shade (Levels 5 - 8) 
**Objectives**: Ghulam boots, claws upgrade(, Hunting boots) 

 By this time you will be level 4 or 5, and the newbie area mobs will have started to turn green. This is time to move out to Shadeweavers Thicket and on to lesser shades, skeletal hunters, swarmers and saurek hoppers, which will mainly be found, as well as some higher level mobs, to the north of the tents and merchants. Collect shadowed claws from the lesser shades for another piece of ghulam armor from Kaza Raj.

It may be worthwhile saving claws and scales from all the various saurek types for some other quest armor items and weapons - but I didn't find them any better than the basic Ghulam armor. See Captain Tarief for the scales and Hunting Leather items. There is also a quest series involving collecting jawbones from shades and other skeletons; talk to Spiritist Karina; these also aren't any better than Ghulam, and the jawbones are very rare.

By this time you should have collected a few high quality hopper hides; these are used in the next stage of the claws quest. If you haven't already, deliver the seal given to you by Poren to Mahron Sood, near the bank, and in turn deliver his map to Kery Miann, upstairs in the tailoring vendor. Use the stone blade she gives you to cut 2 straps from HQ hides (tailoring skill trivial is ??); give them to her with your claws, and you are given new claws, plus a note for Hollowshade that won't be worth delivering until you reach level 15.

Round about level 7, gaining experience starts to slow; you don't have the additional skills to make combat with whites and yellows easy any more, and fighting dark blues will become tougher - and you will notice that these are becoming scarcer, until the brigands and thugs are feasible targets. If so, see my comments about Paludal for a quick boost to your levels. 

## Warder and Spells Strategy (level 9)
 By the time that lesser shades start to turn green, and skeletal hunters light blue, you should have reached level 9 and your warder. Your warder is summoned by casting the appropriate warder level buff spell (at 9, Spirit of Sharik).

As soon as you get your warder, return to your guild and put one training point in each of the magic skills (six of them), and purchase spells. You will want Spirit of Sharik, and Inner Fire; the others aren't essential at this level. Note that Flash of Light is not available in Shar Vahl from the spell vendors, you have to do the whisperling quest to get get it; the closest other point to obtain it is from the Cleric guild in Shadowhaven, which is not reachable without assistance until your mid-twenties. Flash of Light is the next spell to obtain, but not absolutely essential. The other spells are worth having, but not if you are short of money. Cure Disease is available at level 9, and doesn't show up on all spell lists - this is essential if you are going to Paludal to cure Creeping Crud from the fiends. Use the pet window, and learn the following commands effects: /pet attack, /pet guard here, /pet follow me and /pet back off. You may want to drag these off the panel to make hot buttons. I don't disable taunting with a beastlord pet (I do with shadow knight pets only), as their taunting can be valuable to help pull a mob off another group member at times. One command that is missing from the pet panel that you should put on a hot key is '/pet report health'. This tells you what buffs are active on your pet at any time, in case you miss the messages when buffs drop.

In Shadeweavers, all you will need do is cast your pet and buff it, then run around and let it assist you in any fights. You will find it hits for more damage if it hits from the back of a mob, so try to maneuvre round in any fights for best position. More advanced strategies will come into play in Paludal and Hollowshade, where there is less safe room to skirmish. Always cast Inner Fire on your pet, plus the proc buff Spirit of Lightning when you have it (at 15). I haven't noticed Strength making a difference on my warder. At this level, don't bother to practice your casting skills, as until you get meditate (at level 12), the process of training takes too long; you will not run short of mana at this point, so just treat it as a useful bonus when you remember to cast. Note that I didn't recommend collecting either healing spell (self or pet) as a priority - this is because Inner Fire has a better healing effect on you, and your pet regenerates very rapidly - and if your pet is that low in combat that healing is required, you are better off to step in and melee to take the hits yourself. Both Inner Fire and Minor Healing cost 10 mana to cast; Inner Fire is slower, but heals for 20 hit points, whereas Minor Healing only heals for 10. 

## Bandits and Warders (Level 8 - 14)
**Objectives**: Ghulam Bracers, Sleeves, Cap and Pants, Talisman of the Flame, Hero's Shroud

As soon as you reach 10, go and train one point in dodge; then at 12, in meditate.

Once skeletal brigands and Loda Kai brigands turn dark blue, it is time to earn the rest of your Ghulam armor. Brigands of both types will drop skulls, and live brigands also drop earrings; collect four of each. Thugs drop insignia, and are slightly higher level than most brigands. Any Loda Kai can drop the rather rare remains, which should be collected for another quest, for the Talisman of Flame (see Hymnist Omiyad). The live Loda Kai will also give you your first experience of getting money from a kill. On a recent check, the drop rate of the bandit earring seemed lower than I remembered - I had dozens of skulls, several sets of remains, two sets of thug insignia and three of the four saurek fangs before I had one earring, and it took three play sessions to get the set of four. Collect two extra earrings to wear; these have +10 hit points, which is a good stat to have for the level at which you can obtain them.

All of these, and poachers too, can be found most frequently in the area of land between the Gor Taku camp (just follow the path from the crossroads sentry to the West), the skeletal brigand camp (further northwest from there), and some point roughly half way from that base line northwards towards the Paludal entrance.

By the time that you are happy to pull brigands and thugs from the skeletal camp, poachers will also be good hunting. These are found most commonly in the valley between the brigand camp and the entrance to the trader cave (towards the Gor Taku camp), and on the higher ground just north of this. From poachers, collect poached hides for the Champions Cape quest, and ruined cat pelts should you need any for tailoring. The weapons they drop should be given to beastlord newbies if at all possible, as they only sell for a couple of silver. Talk to Sentry Ferrin, near the zone entrance from Shar Vahl, to start the quest for the Hero's Shroud.

The last of the ghulam armor pieces come from collecting saurek fangs, which are dropped by saurek claw beasts (around level 14); you will need four. These spawn sometimes in the bandit camp, and can also be found in the north-south plain west of the path leading to the Paludal entrance. Bloodbulks are also in this area, but are extremely rare, as well as extremely tough, and don't often drop carapaces, which are for the ghulam tunic. I have heard that bloodbulks spawn in the cave system near the Paludal entrance, so if you are set on a tunic, try killing bugs in here until they spawn - I haven't had a chance to verify this.

## Trader Cave (Level 14 - 16)
**Objective**: Blessed Champion's Cape
 At some point you will have a full set of Ghulam armor, apart from the tunic, with tattered rockhopper hide filling out all the gaps, and quite probably a hero's shroud on your shoulders from the poached hides. Now it is time to concentrate on the Champions Cape, which requires two more hero's shrouds, plus three Loda Kai blood. To get this, you will need to deal with the traders cave. Talk to Priestess Bast, in the rocks to the left of the Shar Vahl exit first.

There are two realistic strategies to cope with the cave, and some combination of these is probably best. First, if you attempt to pull anything at all from the cave while standing on the ledge - try casting flash of light or sicken on any mob near the ledge - you will get all of the poachers from the cave rushing you. If this isn't expected, you may need to zone into Shar Vahl, as the guards won't protect you from poachers (apparently now they will - this was fixed in a patch since I last ran a new beastlord through this guide). So you can tell your pet to guard here in the entrance tunnel, and pull the poachers to this point and dispatch them. At lower levels (you'll probably be attempting this from 12 - 14), you will need a group, with at least two others of similar levels; with your warder upgrade, this may be possible to solo pull at 15. The other strategy also requires a group, although it may be possible with just a shaman partner. As the mobs in the cave don't usually wander, if you can dispatch them one at a time quickly, you won't get others joining in - a shaman to keep them rooted is a very good idea. Make sure you brief the shaman well beforehand, as most shamans at this level still think that they are a melee class, and aren't mentally prepared enough to chain cast root - which they will need to do, as it will break a lot. Combining these two strategies to kill a couple of poachers first (if they are on the spawns closest to the ramp), then pull the remaining poachers to the foot of the ramp and take the traders one by one, should lead to you getting all the blood required, as well as any remaining hides, in a very brief time.

The practical alternative is to leave this quest until much later, and come back and let your warder solo all the mobs in the cave until you have enough drops. I was getting about one poached hide and one drop of blood per full clearing of the cave.

To make the Cape, you need to hand in a shroud to Kojjin Kaa to get a pattern; the shroud is given back. Combine two shrouds, the pattern, and one shadeling silk thread to get a Champions Cape; hand this in to Priestess Bast with three drops of Loda Kai blood. You can find them in the rocks behind the tents in Shadeweavers. The tailoring trivial for this is at least 26, possibly higher. I would skill up on silk threads, patchwork armor, and even shade silk armor, which can take you as high as 36.

## Hollowshade (Level 14/15 - 40)
**Objective**: Cloak of the Khati Shah Apprentice
 Hollowshade is much tougher than Shadeweavers; it isn't worth fighting in until level 15, and your pet upgrade. Mobs in Hollowshade are also undercons, and fighting blues here will be much harder for that reason, and so give poorer experience than is possible elsewhere. Your next quest stage will involve talking to Rittuh Purrik and collecting hopper tails; these are another uncommon drop. Make sure you also collect hides and hopper claws. Report back to Kery Miann, who will send you to collect a glowing muckdigger heart from Paludal - and head straight back into Hollowshade. Kery then sends you to Kaam Rahiir in the Library (-250, 130), the southern set of buildings outside of the main palace.

In front of the outpost rhinobeetles and rockhoppers pass by frequently; the guards will protect you from these, so tell your pet to guard here about half way from the gates to the path, and pull to your pet.

Behind the outpost, in the palms and up the ridge, you should normally find owlbears; mostly cubs, but some much tougher. If the war is in progress, these may be replaced by sonic wolves or grimlings; I only met owlbears there on two days ever with my first beastlord (while levelling slowly and carefully), and grimlings the rest of the time. These can be pulled back towards the outpost, but be careful of the guards, who may pass through the outpost walls to KS you. The guards don't seem to attack owlbears, however, although I can't be certain of this.

There are two higher level (about 25 - 30) mobs that roam in this area, and are highly aggressive: Dirtchomp, a giant rockhopper, and Gorehorn, a giant beetle. Keep well clear at this stage; they are magic resistant as well as tough. Now that the Hollowshade War has been fixed, Dirtchomp at least seems to be lower in level than he used to be (dark blue to 35), and much less magic resistant - I didn't have any problem slowing, dotting and nuking him at 35, and killed him solo.

Your mission from Kaam is to collect two molars from sonic wolf cubs; later stages of the beastlord and tailoring quests will require owlbear and sonic wolf parts - these won't be possible to collect if the war is stuck, or if players are using it to farm items. To reach the sonic wolf sector of the zone, just follow the path. There should be a cub or wolfling in the area between the two streams, with few or none of the higher wolfs, so this should be a good area to hunt. The area north of the wolf cave before the Grimling Forest zone should also have cubs and wolflings as well as higher level wolves. Be warned that molars were a rare drop; but I got two of them in three kills in the fixed Hollowshade.

Handing in the two molars starts the sonic wolf bane weapons portion of the quest. By the stage you already have your upgraded cloak, and this item won't get another upgrade until you have moved into Grimling Forest many levels later - at which point it is a very nice cloak indeed. If you want to progress in the quest, you should try to find two tiny owlbear claws, which should drop from owlbear cubs and grapplers, in the area east of the owlbear caves but before the first bridge. These claws are very rare indeed; it took me several days of farming to find them. The claws have to go to Jhimis Khadwi, the jeweller at 310, -370 in Shar Vahl, which is the middle merchant building in the north of the central area. Jhimis will give you the stretching dowels required to make the sonic wolf bane components required from beastlords. I'll leave the weapons quest at this point, as the next stage will require 135 tailoring skill, which won't be feasible until you can clear out the main owlbear caves safely; by this time you will be at least level 39.

As you reach 17, return to your guild and train one point in dual wield.

You will want to come back to Hollowshade later, to exploit the drops you can get from the Hollowshade War, and to continue with the sonic wolf bane quest, leading to the officers cloak. If you are alone, leave this until you reach 49, although it can be attempted earlier; with a group or two, come back at 39 instead. 

## Warder and Spells Strategy (level 15)
 As you reach 15, a new set of spells is available to you - return to your guild and get them. As well as any old spells from level 9 that you haven't yet purchased, you will want Spirit of Khaliz, Spirit of Lightning, Blast of Frost, Sicken, Scale Skin, Strengthen, and Fleeting Fury; the others are less useful. You won't be able to find Sense Animals, which is available from Ranger/Druid guilds, but fortunately also from Gadallion, one of the gypsies in Oasis; this is a very useful spell, but only really in outdoor zones when you are farming pelts! You don't really need Sense Animals; when you tell your warder to guard, he will automatically turn to face the closest mob. Note that you can buy a stack of snake scales from Ragnar's shop to power Scale Skin. It is now going to be worth your while practicing casting to max your skills; use the lowest level spell in each group that you can cast, and cast on a corpse - it is worth finding one just to practice on. Use at least a full charge of mana at each level; improving skills will reduce fizzles, and make you more effective.

To attack using your new spells, make sure first that your pet (level 16, and yellow to you!) has Spirit of Khaliz, Spirit of Lightning, and Inner Fire; Strengthen may or may not have a beneficial effect. You should have Inner Fire, possibly Scale Skin, and Strengthen. Cast Fleeting Fury on your pet immediately before pulling, or while the mob is incoming; Fleeting Fury has the effect of making your pet proc more often. Pull using Sicken, and step back to cast Blast of Frost a few times once your pet is taking the mobs aggro. This hardly makes much difference at this stage, but will be extremely good practice for later levels, as well as keep your evocation skill up. If you let your pet do much tanking for you, and this is an excellent idea at levels 15 and 16, keep a close eye on health, and be prepared to heal if necessary.

In an outdoor zone with roaming mobs, it is generally acceptable to run up to a mob and start fighting, expecting your pet to join in, or even to tell your pet to attack while you hold back for a last minute cast of Fleeting Fury, or to place a dot. However, in some zones this will leave you in the path of roaming mobs, and so is not good practice. For static mobs, and dungeons, this will get you killed quickly. Instead, find a good spot free of mobs and wanderers not too far from those you want to hunt, and tell your pet to guard a few feet back from where you want to fight. This is because your pet will rush forward when you take damage, if you are close enough. It will take a little practice to find out what distances work best. Pull with Sicken if possible; this does very minor damage, but the disease counter hinders normal regeneration while it is active (I believe).

If you find that your pet doesn't return to his guard spot, here's a tip from the EQBeastlord forums; tell him to sit first, then to guard. After that, he will almost always return to the same spot.

When both you and your pet are in melee range, mobs will only attack you (this applies to any player). I have only ever seen pets take aggro when a mage pet is fighting alongside our pet (this may apply to necromancer pets as well, but I haven't had the opportunity to find out). Unless you are below the magic 20 - 30% hit points level, or have done something else to increase aggro, aggro will normally stay with your pet as you move back. During the course of a fight, manage the damage that both you and your pet are taking by moving in and out of melee range. Back off and heal yourself at a suitable level - depending on mana and other factors, I may set this at anywhere from 60 - 80% in good circumstances, or 40% in an emergency. Your pet will take a lot more damage when you aren't in melee, so if your pet is below 40%, heal your pet first. The pet heal spell is fast and heals for a reasonable amount (almost 30% for the level 16 pet), and has the added bonus of curing disease.

If you are fighting in Paludal, many mobs are positioned just outside the assist radius of each other, but are otherwise very tightly positioned. This means that if you pull them back to a safe spot, you will usually aggro several at a time, and will be in danger of getting adds from respawning. So instead, it can be a good idea to fight the mob in place; this applies to everywhere in Paludal apart from the bandit camps and fiends. Because most mobs don't run (exception: glowing muck diggers), by standing almost on top of the mob before causing aggro, it will be effectively locked in place when combat starts, and won't get any assists - for most spawn locations. 

## Warder and Spells Strategy (level 22)
At 19, you will have been able to get Serpent Sight and Tiny Companion (Plane of Knowledge only); neither of these are very useful, unless you often group with a human/erudite. At 22, you get a new pet (level 22), a proc buff (Spirit of the Blizzard), a stamina buff (increases your hit points as well as reduces fatigue, so essential), a better heal (still not as mana efficient as Inner Fire, but much faster), a dot upgrade (Tainted Breath) and your first slow (Drowsy). The remaining two spells are both useful, Summon Drink and Endure Poison, and by this point you should be able to afford them all. Practice a lot with Summon Drink, as it uses conjuration, which skill is required for your dots. Endure Disease will become available for you at level 24. The various pet proc buffs all cause your pet to proc a direct damage for increasing amounts (62 - 82 for the first 3 buffs) - but are based against different resists, and the higher buffs last for longer durations (40 to 44 minutes) and higher mana cost (50 - 70).

Always cast Drowsy on all mobs you will be meleeing, always. At first, you may have some trouble casting Tainted Breath unless you have been practising a lot, but Sicken should still be reliable to cast. I usually choose to pull with Drowsy at this point, but that assumes that Tainted Breath is a reliable cast; if it isn't, I'd probably swap the two around. In either case, I'd cast one to pull, and the second on incoming - for a marginal mob I need them slowed, and dotted as well if possible. Your nuke doesn't do much damage to mobs even at the start of this spell level, but it is good to cast to keep evocation skill practised.

Towards the end of this spell level, you will find that most dark blue mobs can whip you on your own, without your warder, and even with your warder, you will take a lot of damage. When this starts to happen, remember to back off before you get too low, and heal your warder. At 29, you should be able to solo white and yellow mobs by pulling with slow, dotting, and sending in your pet before they reach you. Then sit back and med, and chain cast Fleeting Fury and your pet heal; only step in when you are low on mana, and when the mob starts to run. Remember to step in for melee, otherwise you have no way of keeping combat skills up, and will regret this very much at later levels. 

## Paludal (Level 8 - 24)
**Objective**: experience!
 Paludal is a dungeon zone (with a hefty experience bonus, some say perhaps 35% - it is actually closer to 100% over normal hunting areas) that is very well laid out for Vah Shir starting from both Shadeweavers and Hollowshade entrances.

It is probably best to start at level 8, although 7 or even 6 is certainly possible, at the Shadeweavers entrance. To reach it, follow the path north from Shar Vahl, and drop into the cave; in there, take the first left turn, then the next two right turns. Beware of the diggers in there - they are tougher than the mobs inside Paludal, and are both aggressive and social. So just run by them without stopping, making full use of the tunnel sides to stay out of reach. Inside Paludal you will find a series of mud burrowers and mud diggers; these too are social, but they are not aggressive, and most of the spawns in the first tunnel can be taken one at a time - if you find you pull two, run to the zone to lose aggro, and zone straight back in. The first pond area has slightly higher level bugs and lower reishi, and includes a couple of reishi spawns - these hit a lot harder, but are non-social. If you are at the lower level range, some of the reishi will be dark blue and suitable, as well as those in the first tunnel to your right. Keep on going, but stop as soon as you see the fiends ahead in the next couple of pond areas. Moving up and down this corridor will take you to 12 with ease.

Solo, I normally start with the reishi at the pond, and stay on reishi in the right side corridor until 11. In a duo or group, chain kill the bugs as you go, as you can easily handle the adds, and need the larger total pool of mobs to kill.

When too many of the mobs are light blue, so that you can't continually move from one dark blue to the next, it is time to try the Hollowshade entrance. Go back through Shadeweavers and Shar Vahl into Hollowshade; be very careful there, as mobs are social and aggressive, and much higher level. Run straight south along the higher zone sides to the lake. There you will see a cave entrance at the west extreme of the lake, with a short tunnel leading to the Paludal zone line. You will need to swim a short distance to climb onto the rocks leading into the cave; run in and zone if you have collected a train of beetles.

The first tunnel here is very profitable for experience at this level, and full of muck diggers and some grime tunnelers with a single, slightly tougher, reishi. Glowing muck diggers are tougher (about level 14) and much more social, but will drop a glowing heart stone for the latest stage of your beastlord cloak quest; you can do this at 14, or with ease at 15. Be warned that glowing muck diggers run when low, which can cause a lot of adds. The normal muck digger hearts are for a shaman quest. Move up and down this passage until they turn light blue (probably around 16). This passage can support two small groups, although it is also popular with power levellers, unfortunately.

Next, move to the end of the passage in sight of the fiends. All will be dark blue. Some can be easily single pulled, although you will get twos and threes at times. Work out which points will do which - the obvious single pull is the one to the right of the entrance, but the two on rocky points can also be single pulled, provided they are dealt with in order. The fiend to the left will usually bring three at a time. Fiends will get you to 18 easily and quickly, and they drop some reasonable loot. Fiends also give you Creeping Crud, which lasts for 90 minutes, and does enough damage to counteract your normal hit points regeneration while it lasts. For this reason, use Cure Disease (level 9 spell) at the end of fights, and remember that your pet heal spells also cure disease on your warder.

As you reach 17, you will gain dual wield; remember to carry and equip a second weapon!

When too many are light blue, it is time to move into the next corridor beyond the fiends. If you use sneak and stay high on the walls, it is unlikely that they will attack. Remember to con a test fiend before moving; if you are behind it and it is indifferent, then your sneak is working. In this corridor, there are grime tunnelers, sediment delvers, and more reishi. The bugs are mostly too close together to safely single pull, plus there are wanderers that can make a safe single into three or more. For this reason, the reishi are a better target. A duo can fight reishi in a continual stream with no downtime from 20 - 24 with ease. There is a single outcast shiknar to the right that will aggro; it also double hits, so take care; until you have levelled up a couple of times it may do enough damage to cause you to take extra downtime for healing and meditation, although you will be able to take it as a dark blue easily. Be careful exactly where you sit - there are a couple of points here where sitting against the tunnel wall will aggro one of the adjacent shiknar.

If you get bored with this group of reishi, move along the corridors killing shiknar; you will eventually end up at the Reishicyben. Collect Shiknar legs and bile (which stack) and carapaces, as these fetch the best cash; a single trip can easily pay you 20 platinum. Shiknar will turn light blue as you reach 23/24, but the reishi will still turn up as dark blue a reasonable proportion of the time. By the time you reach 22, you can get probably slightly faster experience from the higher level fiends around the large lake close by the Shadowhaven entrance and the bandit camps. At this point, you will be able to walk in front of plerg fiends with immunity, but patog fiends, in the inner caves, will still aggro unless you sneak, so a trip to Shadowhaven becomes feasible as you reach 24. They will stop aggroing on you when you reach level 30.

During your time in Paludal you will need to leave to sell up, and will want to spend time in Shadeweavers and Hollowshade to complete your class quests; it makes a pleasant change to be able to alternate between zones, at some times concentrating on quests, and at other times on levelling. Remember that it is more satisfying to do the quests in Shadeweavers and Hollowshade at a point when you still get experience from killing the quest mobs. Check my notes for the other zones to see when you should be training new skills - but block should be gained at 25, which I don't think is mentioned elsewhere. 

## Moving On
This guide so far takes you through the native Vah Shir zones to 24, using just one possibly pattern of hunting. It is possible to stay hunting in Shadeweavers to 20 or more, on the west side of the central ridge and in the caves; and it is perfectly possibly to hunt well in Hollowshade to 35. However, I don't believe that these are efficient places to gather experience, and this guide so far has shown you really all of the good native hunting areas for Vah Shir.

For higher levels, starting at 24, there are several good choices, and no single path can really be said to be the best. At 24 it is possible to hunt in Echo Caverns, Netherbian Lair, or Marus Seru; each has its advantages and disadvantages. My preference at this level is for Echo Caverns. I chose to roam to Sanctus Seru and Katta to perform the Eye of Trust and Earring of Veracity (1 and 2) quests during these levels; the Amulet of the Haven faction quest for Shadowhaven is also a must (less so than for non-Luclin races).

From 22 to 32 (roughly), both Marus Seru and Netherbian Lair are popular hunting locations - neither of which I enjoyed at all. Marus Seru has some good features: it is a wide open zone and most mobs don't aggro, although they are social and will assist others of their kind. Zelniaks and lightcrawlers here will aggro, however. Greyhoppers in particular are easy kills, and drop greyhopper hides (and rockhopper hides), which can take your tailoring skills to 95 easily, and is the simplest way of skilling up for the Vah Shir tailoring quest. Stonegrabbers rarely drop some valuable items (iron oxide, sell it in the Bazaar), although in general I would describe it as a poor zone for loot.

Mobs in Netherbian are social, hit hard, and regen fast. But they drop good cash, and a couple of named mobs drop good loot - the Netherbian Chitin drops from the Swarm Leader, for instance, and the soiled breechclout from the Trog King. However, he is only just about soloable at 30, and would be tough earlier than that solo. Most groups set up at the central pillar to pull netherbians, although each of the holes in the passageway can be profitable pull spots. Trogs are the only mobs that don't aggro initially, so you can safely explore their tunnels to get a feel for the area. This zone is a lot safer for rooting casters than it is for beastlords, especially ones who can dot to death their mobs and safely root adds.

In Netherbian Lair, you will sometimes see a human standing by the exit to Dawnshroud, called Lerin Sardor. If you are willing to escort him to the Nexus, he will reward you with a nice earring (wis +3 and various other stats). At these levels you will need a group to do this, but at higher levels you can easily do this quest solo. Once you have negotiated an agreement with Lerin, he will start walking towards the Nexus; he is going to be intercepted 3 (possibly 4) times by groups of mobs coming out of the tunnels; starting with 2 fungal sporelings, and finishing with 5 Netherbians at the central pillar. The trick to winning is to have your toughest available tanks (probably yourself) stand on top of Lerin whenever he is attacked. Let your warder and/or group kill the attackers. They will concentrate on you, and will ignore Lerin so long as you are in their melee range. Keep Lerin targeted if you can, in case he needs a heal - a cleric/druid/shaman can handle this much better than a bestlord in case of emergencies.

From 27, I would recommend Dawnshroud Peaks. Starting with shroom, either solo or in a small group, then moving on to tribals, this is a very effective way to get to 35 with good loot. By moving targets within the zone, it is perfectly possible to reach 42 here, and return at higher levels to deal with rockhoppers.

At higher levels still, in the 40s, you will have a choice of several Luclin zones. Dawnshroud continues to be a staple with tribals, rockhoppers and stonegrabbers still good. The high side of Echo Caverns also works well, certainly from the 39 pet upwards, and at the same time Tenebrous Mountains is a possibility. Scarlet Desert and Mons Letalis are two other zones that I have only investigated a little as yet, but should apply in this range.

## Echo Caverns (level 22 - 31)
 There are two sides to Echo Caverns, totally separate, with two different entrances. The first is reached by walking through a wall in the rogues guild building in Shadowhaven, with an entrance next to the Soulbinder, and is suitable for levels 22 - 35. The second has an unhidden entrance through the Stout area (south of the Nexus portal), and is good for level 35 to 50. I'll be dealing with just the lower of the two halves for now.

Once you zone in to Echo, turn left and follow the passage, passing through a guarded door (ignore the curtains leading to the mutant area). The rooted tentacles are traps, and will severely harm and even kill a low character, so pass them with great care. They cannot be targeted or fought. You pass through the boglings, which are too high to fight at first. Boglings will aggro if you get too close, but their aggro range is very short. Past the first set of boglings take the passage to the right - a higher level bogling area is straight ahead, which you want to avoid. Take the next right; if no one is hunting there, you will find a room full of needlites. At 22, they will be even through to red - but can be fought singly, all apart from one pair.

Stop on the ledge next to the tentacle trap before dropping down into the room; there is a needlite spawn immediately in front of you in a dip that will be hard to see if you don't already know it is there. To your left along the room wall is a spot where it is always safe to sit and meditate. Summon up your pet and buff up, then med to full. When you are ready, drop down and kill the first needlite in it's spawn location.

No real strategy is involved here, just always remember to drowsy them, as they hit fast - but very softly. Once the pit needlite is dead, move to your left to the safe spot. Then kill the needlite immediately in front of you, then the one (or is it two?) behind him. The next two going anti-clockwise are the linked pair. Kill the one by the entrance next, and leave the pair. When you are happy killing the single pulls, try to split the pair; once it is split, you will be able to handle the spawn very easily. To split, cast flash of light on one, and kill the other; recast FoL when it wears off. It is best to FoL the normal needlite when it is a queen pair.

The near two of the pair will often spawn the Needlite Queen. She is slightly higher than the normal needlites, about level 27, and will cast a weak dot on you. She drops a wing that sells to merchants for about 7pp and is a low level caster back item, and a needlite dagger, which may be a decent piercing weapon to keep. Needlites in general are level 22 to 26, and may drop legs and wings (both stackable), which sell for around 2pp each. This isn't a rich camp, but very much better than Paludal would have been anywhere apart from the bandits.

Respawn time is around 16 - 18 minutes. At 22, these will be tough fights, but you should just about be able to kill the 5 singles and recover in that time, for almost a yellow per spawn. At 30/31, some of the needlites will become light blue, but you will be killing the entire spawn (easy from about level 27) and experience will start to seem slow - but it will still be as good as anywhere else you may find at this level.

Remember at 25 to go to the trainers in Shadowhaven (the secret portal by the Nexus portal) and train one point in block.

If there isn't any competition for camps (which isn't very likely), you will be able to move back and forth from the needlites to the first bogling area, and kill all 4 boglings as well as all needlites per spawn cycle. I haven't hunted the main bogling room or the saprophyte room, both of which are tougher with multiple pulls, and need a dedicated group. I also haven't hunted the mutants.

### Echo Caverns (level 39 - 49/52)

The far side of Echo Caverns contains underbulks, fiends, undead slaves and gnomes. The first set of underbulks (to the left and down the lift when you enter) are killable in your mid 30s, but all the rest need high 30s and 40s to kill. The guards in the evil trainer area are also apparently good hunting. The main set of underbulks and fiends will turn light blue during your high 40s, but the Taskmaster room stays dark blue until 52. I suggest starting here at 44, with Spiritual Light for regen; there are better places at lower levels, notably the cave basilisks in Jaggedpine. Starting earlier at the four underbulks ledge with KEI is certainly an option. The four underbulks at the elevator are much lower level, and could be used to fill in the level from needlites and boglings to the underbulk ledge.

The first room heading straight back past the gnome area contains a four spawn of underbulks. This is the area to start in at any time in your low 40s; and is certainly possible in your 30s, but not as attractive as Dawnshroud because of the slow spawn times. To pull these, start from the near end and pull one at a time; if you get two, in an emergency use flash of light to send one away; with luck, it won't aggro any remaining. The main problem here is trains of Fireclaw/Trillcor, usually from the Deep room; stay alert. In the other rooms, some of the spawns are hard to split. However, if you pull using either Cancel Magic or simple proximity aggro as I suggested for the shrooms in Dawnshroud, most of the time they should pull as singles.

The Taskmaster ante room has seven spawns. Fireclaw or Trillcor can spawn on any of these, give no extra experience, but are much harder to kill. Trillcor has no loot, unfortunately; Fireclaw just his carapace and talons. Some stonegrabbers will turn green at 46, then at 48 about 50% of the mobs will be green. However, because your pet is now grey, it is well worthwhile staying here through 48. Levels 44 to 47 should take 4.5 - 5.5 hours each; 48 5 to 7, depending on the luck of how many greens you get per cycle. The only spawns that you need to take care over splitting are the two as you enter the chamber - pull the one at the bottom (near side) of the room with proximity aggro, and he won't path back up to the next spawn point. Spawn time, in both sides of the caverns, is approximately 18.5 minutes. You should be able to clear the entire room within the repop time from 44 onwards.

The room next to the Deep zone line has eight, possibly nine spawns. Three are fungal fiends, four are underbulks, and the remaining one/two can spawn anything, including the named. One of these last two tends to wander about the room, and can wander into a fight, or into the middle of the three spawn of fiends, making them hard to pull. I have always been able to single pull these, but I have hears reports of people getting multiple pulls even at 48. Just always take care to pull directly away from their friends, and use proximity aggro if you are uncertain. If the nearest mob is a dark blue, they are more likely to aggro than if they are light blue.

At the lower levels, 44 - 46, I could only melee for a few seconds at a time; I'd melee down to 70 - 80%, then back off. Healing myself beyond this consumed more mana than I could regenerate in the down time. At the end of a spawn cycle, I'd usually let myself get low in melee so that I could practice bind wounds. At the higher levels, I didn't need to worry; most of the mobs, apart from the highest dark blues, would only take me down about 20%, even if I melee'ed through. I would always pull with Drowsy, cast an Envenomed Bolt and Ice Spear on all but the stone grabbers. For the stone grabbers, they resist all casts apart from Drowsy, so either melee them or stick to playing pet cleric.

The Taskmaster room will be all blue at 49, with a few green slaves at 51; beyond that, only the Taskmaster himself will remain blue. If you want to pull the Taskmaster from a full spawn of slaves, only the one on the near right will come with him, so it is best to kill that slave first; at higher levels he may pull singly. The slaves to the left will also usually come as multiples; having a cleric, bard, paladin or enchanter partner to pacify them will eliminate this problem. At 49, you can pull these as singles with Cancel Magic; the middle two on the left sometimes come together even so, but two at 49 aren't a problem to handle. The Taskmaster drops (always) a cracked shissar revenant skull; no one knows what it's for. He also rarely drops shissar organs, which are used in the quest from Katta for the Amulet of the Gray Wastes; you need three for this quest, and good races only need apply. Polished scales are vendor loot; the orb of echo ore is a nice range slot Bazaar item.

The gnomes are also blue at these levels; I haven't fought them, but I believe they give good experience if you can discover how to split them.

## Warder and Spells Strategy (level 30)
At level 24, Endure Disease became scribeable, and at 29 Enduring Breath. I haven't mentioned them earlier because I haven't seen much use for them at these levels. Essential spells at 30 are: Spirit of Herikol (new warder), Herikol's Soothing (pet heal), Sprit of Inferno (pet proc), Spirit of Wolf, Spirit Strike (nuke), Spirit Strength and Turtle Skin. I'd also buy Summon Food for more practising, and Shrink, if you plan on fighting in dungeons. That covers almost all of them!

The next spell level is 39, and that's a long time to wait using the old, 33 hit point heal from level 22. You get another good nuke at 34, so keep practising evocation. You'll also notice that your warder isn't quite the killing machine that he was at earlier spell levels; a big improvement, but will need help to kill the mobs that you are hunting even at 30. Soloing becomes a little harder now, and groups are worth seeking out. When soloing, you'll want to pull back to cast and move forward to melee and take damage away from your pet; sometimes you'll just sit down and play 'pet cleric', with your new heal that will take care of around 35% of your warder's hit points.

Through out the spell level, you will want to stay hunting mostly the same level mobs, because your warder stays the same level. You will be able to tank better towards the end of this level, but the relative level of your warder will be getting much worse. At 36, your warder will turn light blue. To kill mobs that are dark blue to him, he will need a lot of help from you; Ice Spear, the nuke you get at 34 will help with this. You should drop Spirit Strike at this point: it does less damage for more mana, and its only advantage is the faster recast time.

The best strategy is to move in and out of combat to balance your hit points and the warders; as you start to get low, move back and let your pet tank. Whatever you do, don't get below 40%, as you may find it impossible to shake off the mob due to low hit point aggro. Keep casting Fleeting Fury on your warder, as the dexterity boost will help it to proc more often.

In a smart group, you are there for DPS (damage per second), which means always meleeing alongside the main tank and your warder, and using your pet heal between pulls. If there isn't a shaman or enchanter in your group, always cast Drowsy on every mob. You may need to ask the groups cleric/druid/shaman to specifically buff and heal your pet, as only an experienced one will be paying much attention to it. The warder will benefit from haste, dexterity, HP, AC buffs, and possibly from strength buffs, in roughly that order.

## Warder and Spells Strategy (level 39)
Essential spells are Healing (100 point heal), Envenomed Breath, Spirit of Yekan (new warder), Spirit of Scorpion (pet proc), Yekan's Recovery (pet heal), and Yekan's Quickening (pet buff including haste). You will also want Spirit of Ox, Spirit of Monkey, and Endure Magic. Spells are relatively cheap, so buy them all. The only expensive ones are Summon Companion (sold in the tunnels in East Commons) and Envenomed Breath - which can be found on the balcony above Spiritist Ragnar's shop in Shar Vahl.

The pet heal will take care of around 45% of your warders hit points; Healing does about 10% of mine. If you have kept up Bind Wound, a single bandage at 150+ skill will heal 3% of your points. From this point up healing is going to get worse and worse, so consider skilling up in Bind Wound. From 51, bind wound will be able to take you to 70%, provided you can skill up past 200. Yekan's Quickening is relatively expensive to cast and doesn't last very long, but the bonus of haste, strength, AC and ATK can't be resisted. At this point I gave up on Fleeting Fury, and instead relied on Spirit of Monkey to boost my warder's dexterity for procs.

Remember to train in riposte at level 40.

Before the next major spell level at 49 you will get the highly important spell Spiritual Light (mana and health regen by 3 points per tick each), and the Legacy of Ykesha quested dot, Malaria - unfortunately the quest isn't possible to complete until you are in your mid 50s. Spiritual Light can be found on the shaman vendors in Shadowhaven (only). You will also have another phase of having to support a light blue warder, which he turns at 43, then green at 48. Keep using Flash of Light (and Sense Animals, if you have it), in readiness for getting Invisibility at 49.

## Dawnshroud Peaks (levels 26 - 52)
 Dawnshroud can take the right class from 26 up to their low 50s very easily. It doesn't have the big experience boost of some other zones, but is easy hunting. At first only named mobs, shroom, rockhoppers and lightcrawlers are aggro on beastlords, and only the named and lightcrawlers roam. Druids, rangers and shamans as well are safe from the wolves, but all other classes will aggro the wolves, who roam the zone as well as spring from traps. Only the tribals have faction that you can destroy, making them kill on sight to you. From 26 up to mid 30s, the shroom are good hunting. Lightcrawers give decent experience as well up to about 33/34, when they start to turn green; most shroom are still blue at 37/38.

The biggest problem in Dawnshroud is the trains. There is a constant stream of ignorant higher level players running through to Maiden's Eye and Umbral Plains beyond, straight through the shroom patches (which you may well be trying to camp), as well as higher levels hunting rockhoppers and training them to the zone. This means that the quadrant from Netherbian Lair through to Maiden's Eye is not a safe spot to camp, and the building at the Netherbian zone line is positively fatal.

The first spot to camp is at the Sanctus Seru entrance. Come out of Netherbian and turn right along the zone wall. As you get your confidence in the zone and know where the shroom spawns are and how to spot lightcrawlers, you'll be happy to run straight there. Just before the Sanctus Seru entrance is a hill, and at the bottom of the hill is a 3 spawn of shroom. Be careful not to aggro them. If this is clear, you will want to camp these. Pull with Drowsy as usual, and kill - nothing special required. Rarely these will spawn at a higher level; sometimes, a named shroom "Fungi Shroom" with capitals will spawn there, this is likely to be a caster and will kill you quickly at lower levels. Leave it alone. Spawn time is around 12 minutes for these. The droppable items sell for 2 - 4pp to merchants, and drop commonly (1 or 2 on most shroom, probably averaging close to 1 per kill).

To the right of the Sanctus Seru entrance is an open area where lightcrawlers collect. If you are beating the shroom spawn, you can try adding these in. Beware, because lightcrawlers can blind you. I pull with Drowsy as ever, and kill them by sending my pet in, and only start to melee when they turn to run. Keep your pet healed and cast Fleeting Fury when you can. Collect all the lightcrawler drops apart from the cracked shell, and you can turn them in to an NPC in Sanctus Seru for lightcrawler armor. You can't use this, but it should sell in the Bazaar. Move on from here at 34, although the small zelniaks by the entrance will stay blue to 38.

There are two other good spots to kill shroom. The first is to the left of the Netherbian entrance, if you are willing to run the risk of the trains and the rockhoppers. The first spawn out from Netherbian along the zone line is a 2 spawn of shroom (it used to have three, but the third seems to have vanished). Over the hill by some tents with merchants is a three spawn of shroom. Then a bit further off, past the rockhopper caves, is a single shroom spawn. Both of these last two spot are the only places that I have seen the caster Fungi Shroom spawn, so be careful. The spawn past the rockhopper caves appears to have a single shroom in it; and, so long as you don't get too close, you can pull and kill that shroom. However, if you get too close to the ring, two other shroom will spawn. They may be normal shroom, but stand a good chance of spawning a Golden Shroom (level 35 necro), or two shadowknight Fungi Shroom, complete with approx 400 point harm touch. They are killable, but be aware of the risk.

The second is what I call the shroom farm, close to the Grieg's End entrance on the way to Sanctus Seru. It too is close to a group of merchants, which has an outdoors 3 spawn of shroom near it, the only spawn not on a zone wall. Be careful of pet pathing if you go between this building and the zone wall; my warder seems to want to run the other way around the entire zone to reach me if I do this. You can pull individual shroom with proximity aggro from here, or by casting Drowsy on them if you can see them. One shroom spawns to the left of the main entrance out of sight as you enter the building, and will aggro as you enter the door, so be prepared. I guard my warder a few yards back from these doors, and pull the one to the left, the two in the middle, two to the left, and then the two to the right. Sometimes people camp from the far side of the building at the zone wall; this is a less good spot for both the pathing issues, and because you can't so easily pull zelniaks and tribals there.

After a few levels of this, starting about level 27 or higher, I can add in zelniaks. These don't assist, so you can wander the zone killing them if the shroom are all camped. All types of zelniak are plentiful, especially between the hills in the middle of the zone. You can hit low 40s on these - but the loot is zero.

From your high 20s and low 30s, you can tackle the tribals. Some of these are casters, and will root and dot you as you pull (using typical ranger spells for their level; some may be druids or shamans, possibly) if you aren't careful. They are also social, and have faction - so as you kill them, they will start to aggro on you as you move through the zone. Tribals hang out near the Maiden's Eye and Grieg's End zones, with the higher levels being Tribal Lookouts by Maiden's Eye. The Tribal Hunter, who spawns rarely in the middle of the lookout rocks, usually drops a decent 1HB weapon. These give good experience to 47/48, but most people move on around 40. The great thing about the tribals is that they drop acrylia. Depending on your preference, this is great for tailors skilling up, or just plain selling in the Bazaar.

So far I have advocated mainly killing lightcrawlers and shroom, with the addition of a zelniak at times. Once you are past 34, you can choose to specialise in zelniaks. There are three kinds: small zelniaks, zelniaks, and large zelniaks. Small zelniaks are commonest by the Sanctus Seru entrance, and will turn green at 38. Zelniaks will stay blue to 39. Large zelniaks are possibly commonest around the Netherbian Lair entrance. But the best place as a beastlord to hunt zelniaks is in the middle of the zone, inside the ring of hills where they spawn. Stick to zelniaks until your new pet at 39; large zelniaks have a lot more hit points, and don't give obviously more experience.

For higher levels, mid 40s and up, rockhoppers and stonegrabbers seem suitable - I haven't hunted these yet, however (with a beastlord, that is). The rockhoppers drop superb and flawless hides used in tailoring.

## Warder and Spells Strategy (level 49)
The most important spells at this level are Spirit of Kashek (new warder), Vigor of Zehkes (warder heal) and Spirit of Vermin (pet proc). You will also want Frost Shard (upgrade to Ice Spear, only available in Plane of Knowledge), Spiritual Brawn (atk and HP buff, in Shadowhaven), Raging Strength (replaces Spirit Strength), Protect (replaces Turtle Skin), Frenzy, Invisibility and Counteract Disease. Listless Power is only of any value in PvP; Invigor is close to useless.

These are significant updates to your existing line of buffs, warder and attack spells. Frenzy is a short duration self only stat buff that you should have cast on yourself all the time in combat; fortunately it lasts a lot longer than Fleeting Fury at around 10 minutes. However, the recast time for Frenzy is very long, so you will almost certainly want to dedicate a slot to it; if you still have Fleeting Fury memmed, this should replace it. Frenzy also prevents you casting any spell for 30 seconds, so it is best cast after combat starts; at this level, you should only very rarely be interrupted. Invisibility is extremely useful for safe travel, but won't cast even slightly reliably until your divination skill exceeds 150 (and more). Use Flash of Light to practice divination; you can cast it on your warder or a corpse in a safe spot. Counteract Disease is much more important than it sounds - as you fight more caster mobs, you will find yourself getting slowed; Counteract Disease can remove a slow.

One warning about Vigor of Zehkes; it is less mana efficient than Yekhan's Recovery, and even more so if you still have a Mana Preservation II item, which will benefit YR but not VoZ.

At this point I self buff with Inner Fire, Protect, Spirit of Ox, Raging Strength, Spirit of Monkey, Spiritual Brawn, Spiritual Light and Spirit of Wolf at all times. During combat, I add Frenzy to that list. Inner Fire doesn't add much, so you may choose to drop it. My warder is buffed with Inner Fire, Protect, Raging Strength, Spiritual Brawn, Spirit of Monkey, Spirit of Wolf and Yekhan's Quickening. Again, you may choose to let Inner Fire drop.

## The Hollowshade War
Hollowshade Moor is one of the most entertaining zones in the game - provided you aren't attempting to gain experience there. It's a zone that I have cursed many a time in the past, but that's changed now that the war script is fixed. As it now is, it serves several purposes: as an experience and quest zone for young Vah Shir (14-30); a source for high level smithing components; probably the most exciting mid-level raid zone; and a zone for 49+ people to solo farm interesting drops (many of which are no drop). The two reasons I used to curse this zone were: all the mobs are undercons, with a distinct lack of experience modifier; and the war script was badly broken, with no way to reset the zone to any reasonable status.

Allakhazam's [Hollowshade Moor Quest](http://www.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1609). Check here for details of the drops - the list of mobs is rather incomplete.

A number of decent mid range weapons can be found here: a +5 wis 1HB, a 2HB with dot/debuff proc, several piercers, and an average 1HS. There are two haste items; several items with +2 to +5 wis, various levels of int, skill modifiers of +3% for piercing, and +3% and +4% med, and an FT(I) item.

The west side of the zone is an open field with rockhoppers and rhinobeetles, roughly level 10-14. These drop pelts, and various items for the vah shir quests. Across the south end of the zone is a lake with turtles and fish, also with quest drops, and various ground spawns on the island for these quests. South of the lake on the west side, below the entrance to Paludal Caverns, is another area with a slightly higher density of hoppers and beetles - good to hunt in if you need their drops. As well as the common mobs, a named hopper, Dirtchomp, and a named beetle, Gorehorn, can spawn. These are roughly level 25. It is possible that they can be spawned by killing the "aggressive green" beetles and rockhoppers (ie the ones that will aggro even when green cons).

There are three camps: a village on the south wall, occupied by grimlings; a cave to the east, occupied by sonic wolves; and a cave in the NW, occupied by owlbears - as well as a vah shir outpost near the entrance to Shar Vahl in the NW. All of these four points can be occupied at various times and different combinations by the three factions (owlbears, sonic wolves and grimlings). The war is started by players, and continues until one faction holds all three camps, at which point it will take over the outpost. When a named mob in the outpost is killed, the zone resets back to its normal state.

Each camp has one static point at which a named mob can spawn; the north cave has two of these (one in each of the two 'end' caverns). In addition, there are several named mobs that can spawn outside the camps and will wander about their faction areas. Drops are best from the named mob of each group in their home camp, from which ever occupies the north caves, and from the final named mobs that spawns in the outpost. The drops required for smithing are commonest from whichever of the owlbears or wolves holds the southern village - shrieking and wailing substances (wolves and bears), for shadowscream armor. I should point out that the owlbear smithing drops are also available in Paludal; I am not sure about the wolf ones.

### Running the War

To start the war, just kill the named mob in one of the three camps. That will trigger an invasion from the next camp counter-clockwise, which will be defeated if you don't help the invaders; while the invasion is underway (it lasts for 6 minutes), killing any of the other nameds has no effect. Once one camp has been taken over, invasions are automatically triggered at random every 12 minutes; these are usually, but not always, unresisted. The system seems to be arranged so that all three camps won't be taken by the same group without player intervention, so the team with two camps will always be undefended, and the team with one camp will always defend it. The zone announcement has been adjusted to be reasonably clear if the camp attacked will be defended or not. If the invasion is the one you want, you need once more to kill the defenders, if they spawn; if it isn't, you will have to kill the attackers, which is best done as they start to leave their base. Just one attacker reaching an undefended camp will take it over. I have been told that there is some magic system to force the 'correct' invasion to happen; but watching the person who claimed this, the 'wrong' invasion happened three times in a row, so I assume this is false. I have also heard that you can aggro an attacker and pull it into the winning area, but I haven't been able to succeed with this. Attackers from the north and east leave from the caves, but attackers from the south spawn on the sandy spur in the lake by the east wall. By waiting for the right group to set out and helping them to win, you can arrange for any combination of two groups in the three camps. The attackers are variously called grimling invaders, furious owlbears, and sonic wolf fiends. They are non-aggro, and slightly easier to kill than the general run, whereas the defenders are harder, and they summon. Grimling invaders have two types, one of which (in the yellow jerseys) is immune to changes in run speed; the other is not. Aggro them, and they will turn to you.

As soon as one group has taken all three camps, the vah shir leg it for the zone accompanied by rain and thunder, and the victors take over the outpost. The named mob that spawns is typically level 35ish (blue to 40, green to 52), and as soon as it is killed, the zone returns back to normal.

If you want the owlbears to win so that you can try for the FT 1 range item, first kill the grimling chieftain. He summons, and casts a form of snare (called Quicksand). When killed, he only uncommonly has any of his drops - but you'll need to kill his two bodyguards to loot. These three often drop acrylia, as well as the usual grimling drops. At the back of his hut are two spiritists, who will chain heal. Once the three at the front are down, take out the spiritists. As soon as the chief drops (within 30 seconds), the owlbears set out, and five grimling defenders spawn. These summon, backstab, and use Strong Poison on you. Kill the defenders before the furious owlbears arrive, and the owlbears will take over the village. In the chieftains place will be a screechmaw, who drops an owlbear claw earring or a sinew wrapped owlbear ribcage (chest slot).

Next, you will have 18 minutes from the chieftains death, 12 minutes from the owlbears taking over the village, to get to the wolf cave in the east. If the wolves attack the owlbears, five sonic wolf fiends will set out. It is easiest to kill them as they parade outside the cave. Keep on doing this every 12 minutes until the owlbears attack. Then three sonic wolf defenders will spawn; kill these - I think they can summon as well, but it is possible that they don't. Defenders are all perma-rooted. Then race to the outpost.

At the back of the outpost spawns Skriat'Chakku (named owlbear). I target her from the road, then run around the back and cast on her - she warps through the wall onto me, and can be safely killed without interference from the other owlbears. She is immune to changes in run speed. The commonest drop is the owlbear bone club, but both the +5 cha cap and the polished owlbear beak piercer is common. The rare drop is the eye (FT1).

To get the grimling Prince Garzemort, start by killing the sonic wolf cave packleader; for Gnarlik, start with the owlbear denmaster.

This cycle can be over in 25 minutes; at times, it has taken close to 90 minutes if the luck of the random number generator was against me. The same approach, with a different starting point, can result in each of the three groups winning. The boss wolf, Gnarlik, is a reasonably easy kill. The hardest is the grimling Prince, who is extremely magic resistant. He sometimes resists both Splurt and Bond of Death, which are generally never resisted; life taps seemed to always land. Cold nukes always landed for full; I don't know about fire. If left to their own, they can easily kill a level 49 pet, although they are easy solo kills at that level.

### Mid Level Raid Plan

If I was intending to do this as a mid-level raid, I'd want at a minimum 2 groups of 35 - 45s, up to four groups, one with a tracker. Station a group at each of the camps, and use the fourth to track named mobs in the middle of the zone, plus track the invaders. If you have two groups, use one to kill the trigger mobs and kill defenders, and the other to intercept invaders. Start by killing the appropriate trigger mob, then have all groups commence killing all the nameds for the next 5 minutes. In the south, you only need kill the chief's hut (2 healers, 2 bodyguards, and the named). In the north, you should be able to walk between many of the mobs without aggroing, although the entries to the two caves with nameds at the back have two guards that are likely to aggro, and the nameds are close to other mobs, and adds are likely, depending on your level. The only way to handle the east cave is to kill in to the named placeholder, and sit tight waiting for respawns. I have seen someone pull the named through the roof of the cave, but I don't know if this is still possible. The east cave is by far the toughest to deal with. Nothing in the zone can see invis, so it may just be possible to invis a group in to kill at the named spawn point; in the east cave, I can pretty much guarantee 2 or possibly 3 adds, depending on timing.

Killing defenders will be tougher at this level, as they are permarooted and summon. If you kill the normal entry guards (bodyguards/guardians) first, you should be able to kill defenders from one end. The grimlings will be the hardest to defeat, but they don't have wanderers pathing through the defenders area.

Keep killing the nameds until you have enough drops, then cycle through a different way. You should be able to get owlbear/sonic wolf claw earrings for everyone, and a variety of other items.

### Just for Beastlords: the Sonic Wolf Bane Claws and Garrison Cloak

The sonic wolf bane quest at first sight isn't worth doing; the claws themselves are less powerful than polished steel ulaks, which you can easily get for yourself solo at high twenties, and it involves considerable pain camping mobs in Hollowshade to find the required components, as well as a relatively high level (135) in one of the hardest to train tradeskills, tailoring. See the Trade Skills section for advice on reaching this level. However, the end of this series of quests is well worth getting, the Officers Cloak (now Vah Shir beastlord only, unfortunately), and to an extent justifies the time spent on the long camps in Hollowshade.

It is possible to multi-quest to get the Journeymans Cloak, skipping the claws entirely, if you can find someone with the claws already who is willing to MQ With you. You still need drops from the war, but the biggest trouble is over.

To make the claws, you will need first to get your tailoring skill to 135. The easiest way to do this, and cheapest, is to collect a very large quantity indeed of owlbear pelts and shadeling silks, following the Vah Shir tailoring quest; I would suggest 20 or more stacks at least. You can collect these from the owlbear caves, or from the owlbears if they are resident in the grimling village. You will also need a few rare drops: kelp salts from the moor tortoises on the south islands; fish oil soaked rags, rare from grimling fishermen and possibly herders, but common from the grimling chieftain; owlbear tendons from wandering cubs, grapplers and razorbeaks in the north, or from various owlbears if they are in the grimling village; and finally sonic wolf tendons, which seem to only drop from wandering sonic wolves, very rarely, when wolves are in the eastern caves - I got mine from a wolfling. Note that all of the owlbear and sonic wolf drops only come from the wandering spawns outside the caves, not from inside the caves or the wanderers that leave the caves. Combine these with your stretching dowels to create toughened sinew lashings.

Next comes the really hard part: you need to find Shar Vahl citizens who have done the same quests, and trade one of your lashings for their components: sonic wolf bane poison from a rogue, reactive sealant soak from a shaman, a porous claw blade from a warrior, and ceramic claw sleeves from a bard. Combine these in a Weapons Assembly Kit that you buy in the Shar Vahl Library (from ??). When this is finally done, hand in the claws, then your apprentice's cloak, to Kaam Rahiir (in the south section of the Library at -250, 130). You will be given a journeyman's cloak, and told to take the claws to Ahom Gurzhin, who stands in the cave entrance to Grimling Forest in Hollowshade; this is incorrect, he only wants to see your journeyman's cloak. Ahom gives you a journal to deliver to Historian Sharar (140, 70 in the north section of the Library), who in turn gives you a note to deliver to General Avilah. The General is also in Shar Vahl, on the top floor of the building in the north section before the Hollowshade bridge, at the west end of that area - he is at 380, 440, up the outside steps. The General gives you a box, and wants you to combine in it your journeyman's cloak, and three rare drops from Hollowshade. You will need: a grimling chieftain's staff, which drops from the grimling chieftain and the spiritists in his hut; an owlbear guardian talon, which drops from owlbears in the north cave; and a sonic wolf guardian fang, which drops from sonic wolves in their cave. Combine these items and return the box to the General, and you will be rewarded with the Garrison Cloak, and a note to deliver to Veteran Darznel, who is in Grimling Forest.

## Malaria and Bond of the Wild - Legacy of Ykesha quested spells
These are two mid level spells that can only by obtained by questing in the Legacy of Ykesha zones. The quest results seem to have been reversed, as it is far easier to obtain the level 52 spell than it is the 44 spell, and it drops in a far easier zone, along with drops for other classes 44 spells.

###  Bond of the Wild
 This spell is a pet buff spell, with haste, atk, armor class, and strength. It also gives you (not your warder, you) 130 extra hit points. The haste is the same as the level 39 Yekan's Quickening, and consumes more than double the mana; however, it lasts six times as long. The HP buff alone makes it worth using. I continued to use Bond of the Wild until I got a better HP buff, Talisman of Altuna, at which point I switched to use that in combination with the upgraded pet haste that had been available for a couple of levels.

The quest to get this spell starts at the lighthouse in Gunthak. Outside the lighthouse is a barbarian beastlord (without a warder), Craegin Coldtongue. Hail him, and follow the prompts until he gives you a stone. Your task is to locate his missing warder and give him the stone. The warder is called an "injured wolf", and appears among the huts outside the wooden fort on the way to Dulak. There are several ways that you can complete this quest, either solo or in a group. Probably the best way is to join a group of people looking for their level 44 quest spells - the drops for cleric and enchanter quests that I know of (and several other drops that look like quest drops) appeared commonly while I was searching for the wolf. Alternatively you can use invis to locate the wolf from 49 (when we get invis), or earlier with a caster partner, or invis potions bought at the lighthouse for 10pp each. Finally, you can wait to 52 when you can scribe the spell, and kill the area - but at which point everything is green.

To reach the fort, swim south from the lighthouse; you want to land at the far right of the beach. Everything on this side is live, so invis will keep you safe. Take the tunnel to the right at the back of the beach. If you appear, the drogmors have a large aggro radius, far larger than the lotuses. Without backup, they will kill you quickly, so be careful. Continue through the tunnel until a turn the the left, which leads to the fort. My choice was to kill my way through the tunnel, although this will be hard at lower levels. At the fort, the outer area is surrounded by huts. To the right is the entrance to the fort, which has a higher density and level of mobs. If you turn left, there is a small alcove in the outer wall a few feet from the end of the branch tunnel that never seems to have any wandering mobs come close. Each hut will have one or two mobs, marauders, plunderers and pillagers (lower level). There are also some static mobs of the same type, and wandering Broken Skull Warriors, Guards and Mystics. The latter are shamans, and will sow all the mobs in the huts that they pass by.

Everything hits hard, is moderately magic resistant, and has highish hit points. They all run at 20% hp. Aggro distances aren't big, but a sow'ed runner will attract several adds unless you nuke it down quickly. The only casters are the Broken Skull Mystics (and possibly some of the warriors/guards); Spirit of Wind will interrupt their casting. Greens would routinely resist Sha's Lethargy at 52, Venom of the Snake was resisted frequently, and even Frost Shard was fully resisted a number of times. Drops include some low grade cash loot (gems, etc), around 4pp, weapons which mostly sell for around 4pp, shivs which are worthless, elven blood, various "parts", and a matted fur cloak; apart from the quest drops, that is.

The wolf may spawn at any spawn point (possibly just those for marauders and pillagers, although I can't confirm that). She may wander, or may be lying down in a hut: and thus be hard to see. The best way to find the wolf is to ask a tracker - remember, rangers, druids and bards can all track. The wolf doesn't seem to show up with Sense Animal; I was casting it regularly and immediately before I took a quick check while invisible, with no luck (which is when I eventually found her, after 12 hours of camping). If you have a reasonable divination skills (I'd suggest at least 150, best trained by using Flash of Light or Sense Animals a lot), you can do this solo; an invisibility potion from the lighthouse in case it drops may be a prudent precaution. You can hand in the stone to the wolf while invisible; however, when you do so, invis will drop, so it is better to clear the area as soon as you locate the wolf.

Handing the stone to the injured wolf will give you a glowing collar, which you should return to the quest giver. He in turn will give you the spell scroll and some experience (3% at 52), as well as some hints to lead into the next quest.

###  Malaria
This spell is a level 44 dot, with no initial damage (so it won't break roots). It does roughly the same damage as the 52 spell, Venom of the Snake. I would say that it is effectively replaced by VoS, and is of value only in situations where you are grouped with a root caster, or where you want to stack dots. It does a total of 405 damage for 140 mana in 9 ticks, as opposed to Venom of the Snakes 453 for 160 in 7 ticks, or the level 39's Envenomed Breath, which does 219 for 100 mana, also in 7 ticks. The value is that all three dots can be stacked together, for over 1000 points of damage in under a minute, although at the cost of 400 mana. Mana efficiency is slightly worse than that of the PoP nukes (300 damage for 100 mana); stacking the two nukes available at this level (Ice Spear and Frost Shard) will do 450 damage every 30 seconds for 150 mana - and the same pattern continues with higher level nukes. At this point, forget anything you know from other classes about DoT stacking; a beastlords best spell damage is from stacking nukes: to which you might choose to add some DoTs.

To get this spell, you have to travel to Torgiran Mines, and locate "a strange dark powder", which drops from troll brusiers and crazed miners, which can spawn anywhere in the zone - including at the zone in, which is where I eventually got mine. They are considered to be tough at level 56.

To reach Torgiran Mines, travel from Gunthak as if heading to the wooden fort for the injured wolf. Keep along the passage rather than turn in to the fort area. You eventually come to two trolls guarding an open area with more wooden huts. It is best to cross this invisible, although just running across will work. Head directly west, and you'll find two more troll shaman types guarding the exit. This leads to Dulak Harbor. Once in Dulak, the area immediately ahead has scattered Broken Skull scouts, some of whom wander about, so invis is essential here. Ahead and slightly to the left is a large wooden building, the armory - which conveniently is identified by armory guardians who stand outside. Enter the building, and to your right is a wooden ladder, which leads to a cat walk which takes you into Torgiran Mines.

## Author's Notes

### My Motives and Excuses

The Vah Shir have one of the best starting areas and newbie quest series in the game, and yet I often used to see (pre-Planes of Power) level 1 newbies asking for ports off Luclin; this could only be, I felt, the result of a profound ignorance of the area, and a fear of this ignorance being discovered, as well as revealing a reluctance to play Everquest in the (semi) roleplaying way that seems to suit it best. I believe that there is an excellent sequence of zones and quests suitable for a Vah Shir beastlord, one that gives the best experience in the game for any race/class combination, with very appropriate quests and above average gear. There are still some bugs in the quest sequence, but the bugs in the Vah Shir quests are not too disruptive (at the young levels). All of the newbie quests suffer from keeping you hunting greens for far too long; the Vah Shir may have you do this less than others. 

### My Beastlord Bio

I made my first beastlord and first Vah Shir on Bristlebane around May, 2002; only my third ever Everquest character. I leveled him to 32, mainly in the company of my wife's first character, a Vah Shir shaman, before writing the first draft of this guide on holiday in Hawaii in June 2002, entirely from memory and my notes (no web access). I had already seen guides for other beastlord races on the EQ Beastlords site, but no Vah Shir guide, and felt that the unique situation of Shar Vahl lent itself to a roleplayer's guide to the class. I took up to September to review and rewrite the guide, which at that point went up to level 24 only. In December 2002, I created a new Vah Shir beastlord on a different server, Venril Sathir, and leveled him up to 24 over three days elapsed time with 24 hours played to review the guide, and noticed quite a few minor changes that I needed to adjust for. By June 2003, he had leveled to 52, with only just over 10 days played time, by way of helping me write the then current draft that extended my detailed outline up to that level. By September 2003, he had reached 61 with 10 AAs, Coldain Prayer Shawl 5, Officers Cloak, and 20 days played. As of September 2004, he is level 65 (for some time) with epic and 100+ AAs. 

### What's Missing?

I am conscious that the levelling guide could be expanded; this will always be true. I haven't explicitly covered anything to do with the most recent expansions: GoD, OoW, DoN, PoR and TSS; they don't have much impact on these lower levels. There are spells, armor, augments and other aspects from these expansions that I have ignored. I will have to expand some sections to cover starting in Crescent Reach as an alternative, and all the armor quest series available there. Some aspects are best covered elsewhere: so for gear choices, I have linked to a thread on www.beastlords.org; and my AA coverage describes starting choices only.

Since I last updated this, the Tutorial zone has been expanded to cover up to level 10 and use the task system; spells have been reallocated to be every level, and new tradeskill based armor quests have been added (DoN). Why so slow on updates? Because, like many Everquest players, I have been playing World of Warcraft since February 2005 (European release date), with a level 60 hunter, rogue, warlock and (soon) warrior. I haven't completely given up on Everquest, and intend to update this guide as things change while I still keep an account open.
