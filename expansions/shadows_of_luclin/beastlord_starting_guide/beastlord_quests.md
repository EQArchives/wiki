### Zones to Hunt

---

### General Notes

#### Jewel Drops
All four jewel types (Sky, Sun, Moon, Star, Cloud, Meteor, Astral) drop randomly from **any mob in Twilight Sea quest zones**. These are the easiest pieces to acquire - just kill common mobs and eventually you'll get the ones you need.

#### Faction Effects
Quest hand-ins affect faction with various NPC groups. Current faction impact list is incomplete - more documentation needed on specific faction changes per quest.

#### Mobile Spawns
Several quest mobs are wanderers rather than static spawns (e.g., Adamantium Thought Leech in Mons Letalis, Cral Ligi mobs in Tenebrous Mountains). These typically have placeholder mobs that spawn in their place, and your target appears after defeating enough placeholders.

#### Best Farming Locations
For efficient hunting:
- **Jewels**: Camp trash mobs in any Twilight quest zone - random drops
- **Rockhopper Marks**: Base of ramp to plateau in Scarlet Desert (5-7 hoppers in area)
- **Legendary Sea Turtle**: Twilight Sea (for Frosted Stone)

---

### Changes & Clarifications from Modern Sources

**💡 Recommendations:**
- Jewels are your bottleneck - farm these first from common mobs
- Focus on one or two pieces at a time to consolidate farming efforts
- Roaring Idol (Vicious Shadow) and Blue Moonstone (Vas Ren Lunar Khan) are specialized drops - worth knowing locations
- Consider trading quest pieces with other beastlords if your guild has them

## Vah'Shir Beastlord
>See also [Vah Shir Beastlord Quests](vah_shir_beastlord_quests)

### Citizen Quest & Initial Progression (Levels 1-4)

The first quest is the citizen quest given by your guildmaster, which awards a slate and a cloak (AC 2). Take the slate to **Animist Poren** (standing next to the guildmaster) for the next quest.

**Poren's Quest** requires combining a pattern with 3 bandages to create gloves (AC 3). Return the scraps to her for the next part. Silk can be obtained from Xakra Silkworms in Shadeweaver Thicket.

**Third Quest** involves collecting gloves, 2 claws from young rockhoppers, and foraged fasteners, combining them in a stitching kit to make claws (6/37 Hand to Hand). After completing the initiate quests with Poren, she sends you to **Marhon Sood** to turn in a seal. Once done, go to **Kery Miann** with a map. She will give you a knife to cut two strips from high quality rockhopper hides. Turn in the two strips with your two claws for upgraded claws (7/28, STR 1, DEX 1).

**Tailoring is required for all these initial quests.** The hand-to-hand weapons improve progressively through the quest series.

---

### Champion Cloak

**Part 1**
Hunt the Loda Kai camp in the caves. Collect at least 12 Poached Hides (get 6 more if you want the shoulders or for extra failures) and 3 Drops of Blood. Both poachers and traders spawn here and drop these items.

**Part 2**
Seek out **Sentry Fenin** and hail him. Say "what about poachers" then "I will champion their cause." He will hand you a coffin. Place 6 poached hides in the coffin and combine. Give the coffin back to Fenin and repeat this process to get 2 Hero Shawls.

**Part 3**
Talk to the NPC just as you exit Shar Vahl. Make a left and head for the group of rocks behind the first tent. Hail the NPC there. Say "I am a hero." He will ask for proof. Give him ONE shoulder and he will return it with a Champion Pattern.

**Part 4**
Combine the 2 Hero Shawls, a Shade Silk Thread, and the pattern in a sewing kit to get a Champion Cape. (Tailoring skill 28+ recommended; may require multiple attempts.)

**Part 5**
Go to **Priestess Bast** sitting on the ground in the same rock section. Hand her the Champion Cape and the 3 Drops of Loda Kai Blood.

**Reward:** Blessed Champion Cape - AC 8, STR 2, CHA 2, WIS 3, SV Cold 10, Faction Modifier (becomes Ally to most city NPCs)

### Kaza Raj Armor

**Location:** Hunt in Shadeweaver and look for a guard house to the right of the path. A man named **Kaza Raj** stands outside.

Ask him for specific pieces by saying "What [armor piece]?" (e.g., "What tunic?", "What gloves?"). For each piece, he will ask for 4 of a specific no-drop item.

**Available Pieces & Requirements:**
- Gloves - 4 Cht'thk Mandibles
- Pants - 4 Saruk Fangs
- Tunic - 4 Bloodbulk Carapaces (rare spawns)
- Bracer - 4 Broken Skulls
- Boots - 4 Shadowed Claws (off Shades)
- Sleeves - 4 Loda Kai Earrings
- Cap - 4 Loda Kai Insignias (drop off thugs, look like shields)

---

### Useable Shield

Visit the **Master Smith (merchant)** in the armory (the building where Kagazz stands in the alcove). Tell him "I am looking for work" and then ask "What broodlings?"

Purchase the **Carapace Shield Frame** from him (it's an 8-slot pack that looks like a shield; scroll past all the molds).

Hunt **Cht'thk Broodlings** (little rhino-beetles) in Shadeweaver's Thicket and collect 8 of their carapaces. Combine the 8 carapaces in the pack.

**Reward:** Shield - AC 4, SV Disease 4

**Note:** Since Beastlords cannot dual wield until level 17, this shield is useful for the secondary slot until then. Shields are frequently sold to merchants and can often be purchased from vendors near Shar Vahl for just over 3 platinum each.
