## Travel Guide

### Portal Mechanics and Locations (Detailed)

> **Portal Mechanics**: Talking to the Nexus Scion NPC at Wizard Spires will give you a Spire Stone to put in your inventory. These portals activate every **15 minutes** on a continuous timer and will port you **to The Nexus**. The timer is not based upon when you hail the Nexus Scion.

Portal locations on Norrath:

- **[North Karana](https://www.eqarchives.com/zones/view/northkarana){:target="_blank"}** - /loc -3695, +1215, -8 (south part of the zone, near guard tower)
