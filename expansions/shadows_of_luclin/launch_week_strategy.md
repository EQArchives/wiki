## Launch Week Strategy

> **For Level 60 Players from Velious** - This guide assumes you're already at level 60 and focuses on AA accumulation and raid preparation. New Vah Shir and Beastlord players should see the leveling guide.
{.is-info}

> **Critical Priority**: Alternate Advancement grinding is more important than any other activity in Luclin. 30 AAs in the first week provides more power than any gear upgrade. Players who delay AA farming will be significantly outclassed within two weeks.
{.is-warning}

### The First 24 Hours

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Set AA Slider to 100%** - Do not worry about L60 experience until you have 100+ AAs
2. **Travel to Luclin** - Use Nexus spires in North Karana, Greater Faydark, Tox, or Dreadlands
3. **Set Up Bazaar Trader** (optional) - Sell Velious gear and buy Luclin upgrades during the economy surge
4. **Find an AA Grinding Group** - Solo farming is 75% less efficient than groups

**Best AA Zones for Day 1:**
- **[Acrylia Caverns](https://www.eqarchives.com/zones/view/acrylia)** - Outer tunnels for entry, castle area for best AA rates (requires decent gear)
- **[Grieg's End](https://www.eqarchives.com/zones/view/griegsend)** - Top-tier experience, high competition expected
- **[Old Sebilis](https://www.eqarchives.com/zones/view/sebilis)** - Excellent fallback if Luclin zones are overcrowded
- **[Siren's Grotto](https://www.eqarchives.com/zones/view/sirens)** - Lower competition, good platinum alongside AAs

**For Raiders - Start VT Keys Immediately:**
- Begin collecting **easy Lucid Shards**: Scarlet Desert (Set), The Grey (Kel), Dawnshroud Peaks (Lor)
- These can be solo farmed or done in small groups
- Modern TLP servers have **zone-wide shard drops** and **doubled drop rates** for the first month

**Day 1 Goal:** 
- Casual: 3-5 AAs
- Active: 5-10 AAs  
- Hardcore: 10-15 AAs

{.is-danger}

---

### Vex Thal Key Quest Priorities

> **Timeline**: The full VT key quest requires 30-60+ hours minimum investment. Start immediately if you plan to raid.
{.is-info}

#### The 10 Lucid Shards (Difficulty Ranking)

**Easy (Do First):**
- **Scarlet Desert** (Set) - Sun Revenants, very high drop rate, level 45
- **The Grey** (Kel) - Sun Revenants near NW lake, high drop rate
- **Dawnshroud Peaks** (Lor) - Rockhoppers, high drop rate, level 35-45 outdoor

**Moderate:**
- **Marus Seru** (Azia) - Various mobs, moderate drop rate
- **Sanctus Seru** (Fer) - City content, moderate difficulty
- **Mons Letalis** (Ros) - Outdoor zone, accessible

**Hard (Save for Later):**
- **Fungus Grove** (Dat) - Shik'nar guards/priests, ~5% drop rate, 10+ hour camps possible
- **Ssraeshza Temple** (Vin) - Basement skeletons, low spawn rate, dangerous area
- **Akheva Ruins** (Ent) - Raid zone, requires group/raid
- **Acrylia Caverns** (Jen) - Named mobs, competition expected

#### Other VT Key Components

**Shadowed Scepter Frame** (1-2 hours):
- Farm Sacrificed Remains in Akheva Ruins (sacrificial pit)
- 10% chance to spawn A Shimmering Presence
- Trade Summoned Wisp Stone + Essence Emerald (both buyable in Bazaar)

**Planes Rift** (Requires Emperor kill):
- Drops from A Shissar Wraith after Emperor Ssraeshza dies
- Each wraith drops ~8 Rifts, Emperor spawns multiple wraiths
- Guild coordinated, typically weeks 2-4

**Glowing Orb of Luclinite** (Any Luclin raid boss):
- Multiple sources available
- Easiest from early accessible raid content

---

### Raid Preparation Essentials

#### Bane Weapons (Mandatory!)

> **Emperor Ssraeshza and Lord Inquisitor Seru are completely immune to normal melee damage.** Only bane weapons, pets, or spells work.
{.is-danger}

**Emperor Bane Weapons (Shissar-bane):**
- Requires: Shissar base weapon (tradable, check Bazaar) + Strange Green Metal
- Strange Green Metal drops from basement named skeletons in Ssraeshza Temple
- 2-3 week farm, combine with Vin shard collection

**Lord Seru Bane Weapons (Praesertum-bane):**
- Requires: Blacksmithing 130-148 for 95% success rate
- Yttrium components from various zones
- Lower priority than Emperor banes (weeks 3-6)

#### Minimum Raid Requirements by Guild Tier

**Top-Tier Guilds:**
- Week 1: 30-50 AAs for initial raids
- Week 2: 50-80 AAs for SSRA progression
- Week 3+: 80-120+ AAs for Emperor/VT

**Mid-Tier Guilds:**
- Week 2-3: 20-40 AAs for initial SSRA
- Week 4-6: 60-80 AAs for Emperor attempts
- Week 6-10: 80-100+ AAs for VT entry

**Casual Guilds:**
- Week 4+: 40-60 AAs for group content
- Month 2+: 60-80 AAs for SSRA attempts
- May not reach VT before PoP unlock (acceptable!)

### Critical Mistakes to Avoid

#### ❌ Don't Rush to Level 65 (Post-Luclin)

A level 60 with 100 AAs vastly outperforms a level 63 with 20 AAs. The power curve inverts in Luclin. Bank 100-200 AAs before considering any leveling.

#### ❌ Don't Attempt Luclin Zones Undergeared

Umbral Plains, Acrylia castle, and prime zones hit far harder than Velious content. Spend 5-10k platinum in Bazaar on proper HP/AC/resist gear before attempting challenging content.

#### ❌ Don't Spread AAs Too Thin

Complete your core 27 defensive AAs, then focus on your top 5-7 class-specific abilities. Don't waste points on quality-of-life abilities before combat essentials.

#### ❌ Don't Delay VT Key Work (If Raiding)

The Fungus Grove shard alone can take 10+ hours. Starting in week 3-4 when guilds expect completed keys leaves you scrambling and missing progression raids.

#### ❌ Don't Ignore The Bazaar

Set up traders during off-hours to sell Acrylia Ore, Grimling Runes, Rockhopper Pelts. Browse during non-prime time for gear deals. The Bazaar revolutionizes EverQuest's economy.

#### ❌ Don't Solo Farm When Groups Are Available

Group content provides 4-6x the AA rate of solo farming. The difference between 50 AAs and 200+ AAs in month one comes down to group efficiency.

### Quick Reference: Realistic AA Goals

| Time Investment | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 4 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Casual (10-20 hrs/wk) | 20-30 | 40-50 | 60-100 |
| Active (30-40 hrs/wk) | 50-75 | 60-80 | 100-150 |
| Hardcore (60+ hrs/wk) | 100+ | 100-150 | 150-200+ |

### Quick Reference: Platinum Farming

**Best Vendor Trash:**
- Acrylia Ore blocks - 31pp
- Crude Filth weapons - 100-200pp
- Grimling Runes - 1-5pp (stackable!)
- Tae Ew Blood Vials - consistent income
- Rockhopper Pelts - good money in Dawnshroud

**Realistic Platinum Targets:**
- Week 1: 5-10k
- Week 2: 15-25k  
- Month 1: 30-50k

### TL;DR - The Most Important Things

1. **Set AA slider to 100% immediately** and do not change it until you have 100+ AAs
2. **Get the core 27 AAs** (Run Speed, Combat Agility, Combat Stability all rank 3)
3. **Farm in groups, not solo** - it's 4-6x more efficient
4. **Start VT keys immediately** if you plan to raid (easy shards first)
5. **Don't attempt hard zones without gear and AAs** - you'll just die repeatedly
6. **Acrylia Caverns and Grieg's End** are the best AA zones (expect competition)
7. **Bane weapons are mandatory** for Emperor and Seru (start collecting materials)

**Success in Luclin = AA accumulation, not gear or levels.** Players with 200+ AAs at month end will outperform those with 50 AAs regardless of everything else.
