# Alternate Advancement (AA System)

Luclin begins the everlasting AA grind. These are improvements to your character that become more and more necessary as the game progresses. The AA window can be pulled up in game by pressing **"V"**.

> **What are AAs?** Alternate Advancement points allow you to customize and enhance your character beyond the level cap. You earn AA experience separately from normal experience, and can spend these points on powerful abilities, stat increases, and quality-of-life improvements.

### Recommended AA Priorities by Class

* First 6 AAs for all classes:
    * 3x points in Innate Run Speed
    * 3x points into Innate Regen
    **Alternate**: Halfling/Dwarf/Troll may consider Innate Metabolism
    
- [Cleric AA Guide](/expansions/shadows_of_luclin/alternate_advancement/cleric_guide)

**Pure melees**: Rogue, Monk, Warrior - Farm AAs. Warriors need, I believe, 54 AAs to max all tanking abilities and AE taunt. Monks and Rogues need less to be effective from a DPS standpoint, but AAs are still a significant boost to DPS and survivability.

---

**Knights** need to work on defensive AAs asap, rangers and beastlords can focus on DPS abilities and bards get their own mix of essential AAs to work on. All classes should eventually focus on defensive AAs because they significantly increase non-plate tank offtanking ability.

---

**All priests** Priests should usually focus on spell casting mastery AAs, specifically the ones to increase buff duration, increase mana savings, increase healing amount (this works with percentage CHs) and increase innate FT before moving onto offensive AAs. 

---

**Pure Casters** - Wiz, Nec, Enc, Mag - initial AA focus should be on buff extention/mana pres/defensives for enchanters, mana pres/dps for wizards and magaes, and mana pres/whatever you want for necros because necros don't get great luclin AA's - I recommend defensives.

**[TAKP AA Sheet](https://wiki.takp.info/index.php/Alternate_Advancement){:target="_blank"}** - This is how AAs originally looked in Luclin. General AAs have been condensed on TLPs, but this is probably more accurate in terms of what is achievable in Luclin.
