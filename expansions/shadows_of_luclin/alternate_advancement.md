# Alternate Advancement (AA System)

Luclin begins the everlasting AA grind. These are improvements to your character that become more and more necessary as the game progresses. The AA window can be pulled up in game by pressing **"V"**.

> **What are AAs?** Alternate Advancement points allow you to customize and enhance your character beyond the level cap. You earn AA experience separately from normal experience, and can spend these points on powerful abilities, stat increases, and quality-of-life improvements.
