# Alternate Advancement (AA System)

Luclin begins the everlasting AA grind. These are improvements to your character that become more and more necessary as the game progresses. The AA window can be pulled up in game by pressing **"V"**.

> **What are AAs?** Alternate Advancement points allow you to customize and enhance your character beyond the level cap. You earn AA experience separately from normal experience, and can spend these points on powerful abilities, stat increases, and quality-of-life improvements.

### Recommended AA Priorities by Class

* First 6 AAs for all classes:
    * 3x points in Innate Run Speed
    * 3x points into Innate Regen
    **Alternate**: Halfling/Dwarf/Troll may consider Innate Metabolism

**Pure melees**: Rogue, Monk, Warrior - Farm AAs. Warriors need, I believe, 54 AAs to max all tanking abilities and AE taunt. Monks and Rogues need less to be effective from a DPS standpoint, but AAs are still a significant boost to DPS and survivability.

---

**Hybrids**: Ranger, Beastlord, Paladin, Shadowknight, lumping Bards in here too - Everyone should check Shadowhaven/echo caverns (if evil) ASAP for new spells. Paladins get new low level stuns (great for agro on unstunnable mobs), rangers get nature's precision and tangling weeds (near-instant agro), SKs get their percentage agro buff, unresistable hate spells, and mana tap proc, and bards need to visit Sellar Mulletune  in Katta for, among other things, two-minute selos. They will also need to farm mobs for AE resists, AE mana song, and the level 54 overhaste. 

**Knights** need to work on defensive AAs asap, rangers and beastlords can focus on DPS abilities and bards get their own mix of essential AAs to work on. All classes should eventually focus on defensive AAs because they significantly increase non-plate tank offtanking ability. Keep an eye out for dropped spells, but I don't recall anything that should be farmed ASAP besides the bard stuff previously mentioned and the higher level beastlord pet procs. 

---

**Priests** - Cleric, Druid, Shaman - Druids and shamans need to get their CHs from shadowhaven ASAP. Druids should also keep on the lookout in 55+ zones for spirit of eagle, circle of seasons and foliage shield. Druids will need to quest protection of the cabbage (single target glades) - but really everyone should do it for the FT1 earring anyway. 

**Shamans** should keep an eye out for talisman of epuration, disinfecting aura, plague of insects (disease slow) and regrowth of dar khura as spell drops. 

**Clerics** should purchase ethereal remedy and ethereal light from shadowhaven ASAP and keep an eye out for mark of retribution and blessed armor of the risen as important spell drops. 

**All priests** should farm remove curse from the giant mushroom in echo caverns as a stopgap until we start winning remove greater curse scrolls. Priests should usually focus on spell casting mastery AAs, specifically the ones to increase buff duration, increase mana savings, increase healing amount (this works with percentage CHs) and increase innate FT before moving onto offensive AAs.

**Pure Casters** - Wiz, Nec, Enc, Mag - initial AA focus should be on buff extention/mana pres/defensives for enchanters, mana pres/dps for wizards and magaes, and mana pres/whatever you want for necros because necros don't get great luclin AA's - I recommend defensives. 

**Wizards** need to visit shadowhaven for lesser familiar until familiar/greater familiar are acquired. Decession is an evac TL so that might be useful for shenanigans and is acquired as a drop from 55+ zones. Wizard's don't get too much else though unfortunately prior to raid spell drops. 

**Necros** should check echo caverns for the disease based snare nuke and will get mind wrack as a 55+ drop which is incredible against any mob with a mana pool. It's a 300 mana tap that buffs the entire group. 

**Enchanters** need to hold out until raids for anything useful beyond trickster's augmnentation. Sorry, enchanters.

**Mages** should visit the bazaar to scoop up all the new shiny focus item spells. Early on these may be pretty important to make sure everyone has viable focuses at raids. Mages should also keep an eye out in 55+ zones for rods of transvergance/mass rods and phantasmal protection, which is a new self buff line that gives extra mana regen.
