# Beastlord Starting Guide
Welcome to the Beastlord Starting Guide! Beastlords are hybrid melee fighters (like a cross between a [Shaman](/character/classes/shaman) and [Monk](/character/classes/monk)) who command powerful animal companions into battle. They combine hand-to-hand and weapon combat with nature magic, debuffs, and modest healing abilities, making them excellent solo adventurers and valuable group members.

This page is a collection of resources for getting started on the Beastlord class.
