## The Beginning

![dragons_of_norrath_entrance_large.jpeg](/dragons_of_norrath_entrance_large.jpeg)

The Dragons of Norrath expansion was announced on January 11, 2005, and went live on February 15, 2005. The initial expansion announcement may be found [here](https://everquest.allakhazam.com/history/news-2005jan11.html). The initial patch message may be found [here](https://everquest.allakhazam.com/history/patches-2005-1.html).

## What's Going On

- A series of events has transpired across the world of Norrath and the familiar faces of Firiona Vie and her nemesis Lanys T`Vyl return to find themselves at the forefront of these events. Unbeknownst to them, a dark influence has seeped into the world of Norrath causing new tensions to arise and conflicts to intensify as the dawn of a new age emerges. The Age of War is upon the people of Norrath and heroes return in this ultimate, unending battle between good and evil.
- A gnome mining expedition has managed to dig their way through the northern mountains in Lavastorm. They came upon the dragon nesting grounds, a previously unexplored part of northeastern Antonica which is full of Nest dragons, dragonkin and goblins; and thriving with wildlife.

## What's New

- The Guild Hall is your guild's own instanced zone, including guild bank, a portal to many druid/wizard destinations, and buff stoppage.
- The Guild Lobby (now available to everyone) is a place for guilds to recruit and for players to summon their corpses.
- New Models: Dragons, Stone Sentinels, Kirins, Drakes, Spiders, Pumas, Dervishes.
- New AAs retrieved through Dragons of Norrath progression.

### Progression

- In order to progress through this expansion, you would be advised to pick a faction and stick with it. You have two to choose from: The good-aligned [Norrath's Keepers](http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=398) or the evil-aligned [Dark Reign](http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=395). Neither faction has any effect on any other zones in EverQuest.
- Both factions have camps set up in the network of caves in Lavastorm's north. In addition to these two camps, there is a group of Wayfarers to the south-southeast of the caves who also offer tasks.
- Completing tasks (both groups and raids) yields X amount of Radiant Crystals or Ebon Crystals, which can be used to purchase items and augmentations from adventure merchants [Tatsujiro the Serene](https://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/npc.html?id=17804) (for the Norrath's Keepers) and [Xeib Darkskies](https://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/npc.html?id=17792) (for the Dark Reign).
- Faction is gained by completing tasks and turning in the token you receive after each task. These tokens are LORE, so you need to make the turn-in after each task completed for maximum faction gains.
    - Norrath's Keepers Tokens are turned in to Tatsujiro the Serene.
    - Dark Reign Tokens are turned in to Xeib Darkskies.
