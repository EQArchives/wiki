## Lore & Background
The gods of Norrath reside in astral realms collectively known as the Planes of Power. Each plane is ruled by a unique deity who guards their realm against mortal trespassers. The planes are organized by tiers of divinity:

- Demigods and lesser entities
- Gods of nature and influence
- Gods of elemental power

The ultimate goal is reaching the Plane of Time, which requires defeating the four elemental gods: Fennin Ro (Fire), Xegony (Air), Coirnav (Water), and The Rathe Council (Earth).
