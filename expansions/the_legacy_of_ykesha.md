## Overview
![legacy_of_ykesha_loading_screen.jpg](/legacy_of_ykesha_loading_screen.jpg =350x)

The Legacy of Ykesha is EverQuest's fifth expansion, bringing significant changes to the political landscape of Norrath. In a dramatic turn of events, the amphibious frogloks—previously NPCs confined to the swamps—reclaimed their ancestral home from the trolls. Blessed by their deity Mithaniel Marr, the frogloks invaded the troll city of Grobb, renaming it Gukta and forcing the trolls to flee to Neriak.

> **Note:** This storyline continued to evolve in later game events. During "The War" event in summer 2005 (August 11 patch on EQ Live), the trolls successfully reclaimed Grobb with assistance from the dark elves, forcing the frogloks to relocate to a camp in the Rathe Mountains. Following this defeat, frogloks gained access to three additional "darker" classes (Necromancer, Rogue, and Shadowknight) as they turned to desperate measures to try to reclaim their lost home.

But not all trolls retreated to the dark elf city. The Broken Skull Clan, long rivals of the Grobb trolls, established themselves on Broken Skull Rock—a treacherous island off the southern coast of Antonica. This is where your journey into the expansion begins.

## The Froglok Race
![froglok_race.png](/froglok_race.png =250x)
Frogloks are now available as a playable race—an amicable, **good-aligned** people with a complex history. They worship Mithaniel Marr, a deity of honor and valor. These intelligent amphibians possess superior night vision and natural swimming abilities, making them formidable in their native swamps.

**Racial Traits:**
- Amphibious (can hold breath underwater for extended periods)
- Enhanced night vision (Ultravision)
- Natural swimming proficiency (starts at skill level 125)
- Good alignment (worship Mithaniel Marr)
- Can wear both small and medium armor

**Lore:** Once locked in eternal conflict with the trolls, the frogloks turned the tide of war with divine intervention from Mithaniel Marr. After seizing Grobb and renaming it Gukta, they enjoyed a period of peace. However, during "The War," trolls would eventually push them back into the Rathe Mountains, where desperate frogloks began studying dark magic to reclaim their homeland.

**Playable Classes (at expansion launch):**
At the release of Legacy of Ykesha in February 2003, frogloks could play as:
- Cleric
- Paladin
- Shaman
- Warrior
- Wizard

**Later Additions:**
Following "The War" event in summer 2005 (a live event that occurred after this expansion's release during the end of Dragons of Norrath and about a month before the release of Depths of Darkhollow), frogloks gained access to three additional classes as they turned to darker methods:
- Necromancer
- Rogue
- Shadowknight

*Note: Monk was added in 2014, much later in the game's history.*

## Key Features

**Armor Dyeing** - Customize your equipment's appearance with a variety of dyes. This feature quickly became one of the most popular additions to the game.

**Guild Management System** - Completely overhauled tools for guild leaders, making organization and communication significantly easier.

## Exploring Broken Skull Rock

The island of Broken Skull Rock lies off the southern coast of Antonica, though reaching it requires a perilous journey from the Stonebrunt Mountains in Odus. This rocky stronghold is home to the Broken Skull Clan, a band of trolls who worship Innoruuk and have carved out a brutal empire based on piracy, slavery, and mining.

**Faction Matters:** Your relationship with the Broken Skull Clan will determine how much of the island you can safely explore. Those who earn their favor will find lucrative opportunities; those who don't may face a swift end.

### Gulf of Gunthak
**Level Range:** 35-40 | **Type:** Outdoor zone, arrival point

![gulf_of_gunthak.png](/gulf_of_gunthak.png =250x)
The Gulf serves as your entry point to Broken Skull Rock. This coastal area houses new recruits and those in good standing with the Broken Skull Clan. A massive lighthouse dominates the landscape, surrounded by lean-tos where merchants sell unique supplies.

Hidden passages throughout the Gulf lead deeper into the island—but venturing beyond without the clan's permission is a dangerous gamble.

### Dulak's Harbor
**Level Range:** 40-45 | **Type:** Underground city | **Status:** HOT ZONE

![dulaks_harbor.png](/dulaks_harbor.png =250x) ![dulaks_harbor2.png](/dulaks_harbor2.png =250x)

Tucked beneath the island's surface in a massive cavern, Dulak's Harbor is a rough-and-tumble troll settlement that serves as the clan's main port. Troll marauders watch every ship that comes and goes.

**For Allies:** The Harbor offers numerous taverns, shops, and services. Railway tracks crisscross the city, leading to the mines where the clan's true wealth is extracted.

**Warning:** A temple to Innoruuk sits near the harbor, heavily guarded by Luggald minions. The hatred emanating from this place is palpable—avoid it unless you're prepared for a fight.

### Torgiran Mines
**Level Range:** 45-50 | **Type:** Underground mines

![torgiran_mines.png](/torgiran_mines.png =250x) ![torgiran_mines2.png](/torgiran_mines2.png =250x)

Deep beneath Broken Skull Rock lie the Torgiran Mines, rich with precious metals and gemstones. These resources are the clan's primary export, mined by slaves and transported to Dulak's Harbor via the railway system.

**Environment:** Strange etchings on the cavern walls, empowered by Innoruuk, prevent flooding—though when the tides recede, deadly lava pools are exposed.

### Hate's Fury, The Scorned Maiden
**Level Range:** 55-60 | **Type:** Pirate ship zone

![hates_fury_scorned_maiden.png](/hates_fury_scorned_maiden.png =250x) ![hates_fury_scorned_maiden2.png](/hates_fury_scorned_maiden2.png =250x)

This legendary pirate vessel isn't just a sailor's tale—it's real, and it's terrifying. Captained by a vicious crew of troll pirates, the Hate's Fury is laden with stolen treasure and anchored in a hidden lagoon beneath the island.

**Access:** Even with excellent Broken Skull Clan faction, approaching this ship is extraordinarily dangerous. Only the most confident adventurers should attempt it.

### The Crypt of Nadox
**Level Range:** 50-55 | **Type:** Dungeon | **Status:** Restricted

![crypt_of_nadox.png](/crypt_of_nadox.png =250x)

The final resting place of the legendary troll shaman Nadox, this crypt is the most sacred site on the island. Hidden in the deepest reaches of Broken Skull Rock, it's filled with shrines to Innoruuk and guarded by the clan's most elite members.

**Warning:** Only the highest-ranking clan members may enter. Disturbing this place is said to invoke Innoruuk's wrath directly.

## Additional Zones
**Note:** Several of these zones were added in patches following the expansion's February 2003 release.

The expansion also includes revamped versions of classic dungeons:
- **Plane of Hate B** - Added to live servers in the April 8, 2003 patch on EQ Live
- **Chardok: Halls of Betrayal** (Chardok B) - Introduced in the July 10, 2003 patch on EQ Live
- **Temple of Droga 2.0** - Added to live servers in the July 10, 2003 patch on EQ Live
- **Mines of Nurga 2.0** - Added to live servers in the July 10, 2003 patch on EQ Live
- **Veksar** - Introduced in the June 11, 2003 patch on EQ Live.  This zone "completes" the Ruins of Kunark expansion as the previously lost city buried under the Lake of Ill Omen.
- **Caverns of Exile** (Solusek C) - Introduced in the August 6, 2003 patch on EQ Live
- **Cazic-Thule 2.0** - Partial revamp went to live servers on August 26, 2003 patch on EQ Live

>On Modern TLP's, Veksar unlocks during the LDoN expansion despite the fact that it originally released during the LoY expansion on June 11, 2003.  This has been verified by several players.[^1] On emulators that follow the historical timeline, however (EQA), it will release during the Legacy of Ykesha expansion.

## Evolution of the Froglok Storyline

The Legacy of Ykesha introduced frogloks as a playable race in February 2003, but their story didn't end with this expansion. The froglok-troll conflict became part of EverQuest's evolving world through live events:

- **2003**: Frogloks take Grobb, rename it Gukta (Legacy of Ykesha expansion)
- **2005**: "The War" live event sees trolls reclaim Grobb; frogloks move to Rathe Mountains
- **Post-2005**: Froglok class options expand to include darker classes

This made the Legacy of Ykesha zones and storyline particularly notable, as they represented the beginning of an ongoing narrative rather than a standalone expansion story.

**Community Perspective:** While the guild management tools, bank slots, and armor dyeing were warmly received and remain popular features, the new zones received mixed reactions from the community. Many players felt the content was somewhat uninspired compared to previous expansions and added little to Norrath's deeper lore. The expansion is generally viewed as smaller in scope than its predecessors, though its quality-of-life improvements proved essential to the game's evolution.
