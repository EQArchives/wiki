# LoY Spell Guide
When the Legacy of Ykesha expansion released, each class got two new spells that had to be obtained through specific quests in the new zones (primarily Gunthak, Dulak's Harbor, Togiran Mines).  These spells were originally marked as No Drop and could not be purchased from vendors.

On **March 16, 2012** (approximately 9 years after the expansion's release), a major change was implemented:

From the patch notes: "*The scholars of the Library of Myrist in the Plane of Knowledge have expanded their inventories. They now carry most spells, tomes, or songs that an adventurer will need. They do not carry ancient spells or advanced spell ranks.*"

This patch made formerly quest-only and research-only spells (including the Legacy of Ykesha quest spells) available for purchase from vendors in the Plane of Knowledge Library. However, this change also significantly increased spell prices - spells that previously cost 10 platinum now cost 40+ platinum, and level 50+ spells exceeded 100 platinum.

A follow-up patch on **June 27, 2012** corrected some spells that were not properly added to the PoK vendors during the March update.

>Note: On modern Progression/Time-Locked servers, the availability of these spells on vendors may follow different rules depending on server-specific unlock schedules.
