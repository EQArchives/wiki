# Launch Week Strategy
>Farm plat, camp rares, grab AAs, roll a Froglok Monk, and raid Krasnok â€” then wait for LDoN.

Legacy of Ykesha (LoY) does not require much in terms of strategy.  It was closer to an "adventure pack" than a full expansion that takes place between PoP and LDoN.  There are no level cap increases, no keying or flagging, no AA's, and no new mechanics.

On initial release, it only has two [raid targets](/expansions/the_legacy_of_ykesha/raid_guide) - with a third that opens up for Shaman Epic 1.5 when Omens of War releases.

## What Should I do then?
1. Make a Froglok (or a few)
2. Camp for new Charm items
3. Farm dyes

## Camp for New Charm Items
While you are exploring the five new zones in this expansion, get yourself some charms for the new charm slots. See the[Legacy of Ykesha Charm Guide](/expansions/the_legacy_of_ykesha/charm_guide) for more information.
