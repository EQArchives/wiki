# Factions in *EverQuest: The Legacy of Ykesha*

*The Legacy of Ykesha* (LoY), released on February 25, 2003, introduced new zones, quests, and faction systems centered around the Broken Skull Clan, troll lore, and the island of Broken Skull Rock.<sup>[1]</sup> This article covers both **in-game reputation factions** and **lore-based groups** specific to the expansion.

---

## In-Game Reputation Factions

These are trackable factions in the game that affect NPC behavior, quest availability, and merchant interactions.

| Faction Name | ID | Primary Zone(s) | Key Notes |
|--------------|----|------------------|-----------|
| **Pirates of Gunthak** | 180 | Gulf of Gunthak, Dulak's Harbor | Default faction for many pirates in LoY zones. Killing mobs aligned with rival groups (e.g., Broken Skull Clan) raises this faction.<sup>[2]</sup> |
| **Nadox Initiate** | 339 | Crypt of Nadox | Tied to the Luggalds and undead trolls in Nadox. Improved via quests like "Luggald Studies" or killing opposing trolls.<sup>[3]</sup> |
| **Broken Skull Clan** | 44 | Torgiran Mines, Dulak's Harbor | Central antagonist faction. Most player actions in LoY zones lower this faction.<sup>[4]</sup> |
| **Clan Ykesha** | N/A (lore only) | N/A | Not a trackable faction, but referenced in lore as the ancient troll clan led by Ykesha.<sup>[5]</sup> |

## Lore-Based Groups and Clans

These are narrative factions and organizations central to LoY's storyline, even if not all are trackable in-game.

### Broken Skull Clan
- A rogue troll clan that broke away from traditional troll society in Grobb.<sup>[6]</sup>
- Led by **Warlord Ykesha**, who claimed to be a descendant of the ancient Ykesha bloodline.<sup>[7]</sup>
- Worships **Innoruuk** and practices dark rituals, including reanimation of the dead.<sup>[8]</sup>
- Controls **Broken Skull Rock**, including the zones: Gulf of Gunthak, Dulak's Harbor, Torgiran Mines, and Crypt of Nadox.<sup>[9]</sup>

### Luggalds
- Undead or corrupted trolls created through Innoruuk’s influence and dark rituals.<sup>[10]</sup>
- Found primarily in **Crypt of Nadox**.<sup>[11]</sup>
- Associated with the **Nadox Initiate** faction.<sup>[12]</sup>
- Believed to be former members of the Broken Skull Clan transformed after death.<sup>[13]</sup>

### Pirates of Gunthak
- A loose coalition of smugglers, pirates, and mercenaries operating in **Gulf of Gunthak** and **Dulak's Harbor**.<sup>[14]</sup>
- Not strictly troll-aligned; includes ogres, dark elves, and humans.<sup>[15]</sup>
- Opposed to the Broken Skull Clan’s dominance over the island.<sup>[16]</sup>

### Clan Ykesha (Historical)
- An ancient troll clan said to have been favored by Innoruuk.<sup>[17]</sup>
- Ykesha, the clan’s namesake, was a powerful troll shaman or warlord.<sup>[18]</sup>
- The Broken Skull Clan claims direct descent, though this is disputed in troll lore.<sup>[19]</sup>

## Faction Interactions

- Killing **Broken Skull Clan** mobs (e.g., in Torgiran Mines) **lowers** Broken Skull Clan faction and **raises** Pirates of Gunthak and sometimes Nadox Initiate.<sup>[20]</sup>
- Completing quests in **Dulak's Harbor** (e.g., for Captain Skullcracker) improves **Pirates of Gunthak** standing.<sup>[21]</sup>
- The **Froglok** city of **Gukta** (added in LoY) has no direct faction impact on Broken Skull Rock, but shares lore ties via troll-froglok rivalry.<sup>[22]</sup>
