# LoY Priest Spell Research Recipes

**These research combines can be performed by ANY researcher**, regardless of caster class. They must be combined in the appropriate **advanced research container** (see [LoY Caster Research Recipes](/expansions/the_legacy_of_ykesha/tradeskills/spell_research/casters)).

> **⚠️ WARNING:** Some 50-60 dropped spells are **LORE**. Check if you already have a copy before researching!

**Notes:**
- **Parchment and Quill** are [standard spell research components](/expansions/the_legacy_of_ykesha/tradeskills/location/spell_research).
- Other items (**Words, Pages, Runes**) are random drops from higher-level mobs.
- Enchanter page abbreviations:  
  **Finnok's** = Finnok's Treatise  
  **Toharon's** = Toharon's Memoire  
  **Yaeth's** = Yaeth's Compendium  
  **Zeannor's** = Zeannor's Thesis
