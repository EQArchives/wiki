# Legacy of Ykesha Racial Robes

**Legacy of Ykesha (LoY) racial robes** are player-crafted **cultural silk armor sets** introduced with the *EverQuest* expansion **The Legacy of Ykesha** in 2003. These **robes** (cloth armor for casters) are tailored using **race-specific patterns** (often dropped in LoY zones), **cultural threads**, **silk**, and **racial tailoring kits**. Only tailors of the corresponding race can craft them, and the armor is **wearable exclusively by that race**.
