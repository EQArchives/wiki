### What Made Luclin Special

In addition to **24 new zones**, this expansion introduced:
- The feline **Vah Shir** as a new playable race
- The powerful **Beastlord** class
- **Alternate Advancement** abilities for character progression beyond level cap
- **Mounts** for faster travel and safer regeneration
- **The Bazaar**, the first zone entirely dedicated to trading goods

> **Music Note**: It took *20 years* for the Shadows of Luclin music to finally get fixed, but it is quite good. You can listen to it on `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z7b-532mKg&list=PLSCa57dkQP45UdvM84b5XQLz92x9IbH_A`

{.is-info}

### For Level 60 Players from Velious

> **Already at Level Cap?** Your first priority is Alternate Advancement, not leveling or new zones.
{.is-warning}

**Day One Priorities:**
1. **Set AA slider to 100%** immediately (Press Alt+X or right-click experience bar)
2. **Travel to Luclin** via Nexus spires (North Karana, Greater Faydark, Toxxulia Forest, Dreadlands, or Greater Divide)
3. **Visit The Bazaar** to sell Velious gear and buy initial Luclin upgrades
4. **Join AA grinding groups** in Acrylia Caverns, Grieg's End, or Old Sebilis
5. **Start easy VT key shards** if raiding (Scarlet Desert, The Grey, Dawnshroud Peaks)

**Critical:** Keep your AA slider at 100% until you have 100+ AAs. Groups provide 4-6x more AA experience than solo farming.

### Getting to Luclin (Basic)

Portals to and from The Nexus are located at Wizard Spires on each continent, transporting at approximately **15 minute** increments. The Nexus serves as the central hub for all Luclin travel.

See the [Travel Guide](/expansions/shadows_of_luclin/travel_guide) section for detailed Portal locations.

## Character Options

### Vah Shir (The New Race)
![vah_shir_large.jpeg](/vah_shir_large.jpeg =250x)
The Vah Shir are a race of noble feline people who have resided on Luclin for several hundred years. When the Erudites of Odus went to war, a devastating explosion launched a chunk of the continent into space, taking with it a majority of the Kerran population. 

Trapped on the moon, the survivors adapted to their new environment and grew stronger, forced to make themselves a new home on Luclin in **Shar Vahl**. Over time, their people evolved into the Vah Shir, and are now differentiated from their Kerran ancestors.

> **Racial Identity**: Because of their tumultuous history, even to this day the Vah Shir share incredibly close bonds with one another. A Vah Shir will always put their kin first and exhibits selflessness and unwavering loyalty. Powerful and devoted, a Vah Shir is great to have on your side.
{.is-info}

### Beastlords (The New Class)

Beastlords are masters of raw nature with the unique ability to channel this energy into themselves and their pets. They are always found fighting alongside their loyal companion animals, and can enhance their creature's natural abilities with special spells.

A beastlord is versatile in battle. They can engage in hand-to-hand combat using blunt weapons or their bare hands, or hang back to de-buff enemies and help allies with health or mana regeneration using a variety of spells. Beastlords are valuable individuals to have in a group, but can also hold their own on solo adventures.

**Available to**: Barbarian, Iksar, Ogre, Troll, and Vah Shir

## Lore & Background

### The Shissar Exodus

The Shissars are serpent-like creatures who once ruled the continent of Kunark, where they had enslaved the Iksar people. An Iksar hero named Rile started a revolution and called upon a mystical force known as the **Greenmist**, which killed most of the Shissars and made Norrath's atmosphere toxic to them.

The surviving Shissars were aided by the Combine Empire and fled to Luclin, where they built the **Ssraeshza Temple**â€”home of the powerful Emperor Ssraeshza, who according to game lore is powerful enough to slay gods. To protect themselves from the Greenmist, the Shissars magically sealed **The Grey**, a place where no atmosphere exists, and constructed their temple within.

> **Endgame Content**: Defeating Emperor Ssraeshza requires completing a key quest, collecting special **Bane Weapons** (the Emperor is immune to regular weapons), and coordinating a full raid force. The most powerful Shissar-bane weapon is the Greenmist (Sacred Khukri of Rile), a Shadow Knight-only quested weapon introduced in Cabilis.
{.is-warning}

### Notable Locations

Luclin is one of Norrath's two moons and is tidally locked to the planet, meaning one side is constantly ablaze with direct sunlight while the other half exists in never-ending darkness. Both sides are inhabited by different creatures, each offering unique experiences to adventurers brave enough to explore them.

**[Vex Thal](https://www.eqarchives.com/zones/view/vexthal){:target="_blank"}** is the ultimate endgame challenge, requiring an extensive key quest collecting lucid shards from Luclin's most dangerous creatures. Inside, the Akheva and High Priestess Aten Ha Ra guard some of the expansion's most powerful rewards.

**[Ssraeshza Temple](https://www.eqarchives.com/zones/view/ssratemple){:target="_blank"}** serves as the Shissar stronghold, accessible through The Deep's hidden passages or through the airless barrier in The Grey. Emperor Ssraeshza awaits in its depths, immune to normal weapons and powerful enough to slay gods according to legend.

**[The Bazaar](https://www.eqarchives.com/zones/view/bazaar){:target="_blank"}** revolutionized EverQuest's economy as the first zone dedicated entirely to AFK trading. Located adjacent to The Nexus, it became the busiest trading hub on Luclin with banks on both ends and countless trader stalls.

> **For detailed information** on all 24 zones including leveling ranges, camps, and notable NPCs, see the [Zone Reference Guide](/expansions/shadows_of_luclin/zones).
