## Overview

The Shadows of Luclin was the **third** expansion released for EverQuest on **December 4, 2001**. With this expansion, players could travel outside of the realm of Norrath for the first time, journeying to Luclin—one of Norrath's two moons—which offered a whole new world to explore.

### Getting to Luclin

Portals to and from The Nexus are located at Wizard Spires on each continent, transporting at approximately **15 minute** increments. The Nexus serves as the central hub for all Luclin travel.

### What Made Luclin Special

In addition to **24 new zones**, this expansion introduced:
- The feline **Vah Shir** as a new playable race
- The powerful **Beastlord** class
- **Alternate Advancement** abilities for character progression beyond level cap
- **Mounts** for faster travel and safer regeneration
- **The Bazaar**, the first zone entirely dedicated to trading goods

> **Music Note**: It took *20 years* for the Shadows of Luclin music to finally get fixed, but it is quite good. You can listen to it on `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z7b-532mKg&list=PLSCa57dkQP45UdvM84b5XQLz92x9IbH_A`

## Lore & Background

### The Shissar Exodus

The Shissars are serpent-like creatures who once ruled the continent of Kunark, where they had enslaved the Iksar people. An Iksar hero named Rile started a revolution and called upon a mystical force known as the **Greenmist**, which killed most of the Shissars and made Norrath's atmosphere toxic to them.

The surviving Shissars were aided by the Combine Empire and fled to Luclin, where they built the **Ssraeshza Temple**—home of the powerful Emperor Ssraeshza, who according to game lore is powerful enough to slay gods. To protect themselves from the Greenmist, the Shissars magically sealed **The Grey**, a place where no atmosphere exists, and constructed their temple within.

> **Endgame Content**: Defeating Emperor Ssraeshza requires completing a key quest, collecting special **Bane Weapons** (the Emperor is immune to regular weapons), and coordinating a full raid force. The most powerful Shissar-bane weapon is the Greenmist (Sacred Khukri of Rile), a Shadow Knight-only quested weapon introduced in Cabilis.

### The Moon of Luclin

Luclin is tidally locked to Norrath, meaning one side is constantly ablaze with direct sunlight while the other half exists in never-ending darkness. Both sides are inhabited by different creatures, each offering unique experiences to adventurers brave enough to explore them.

## Quick Start Guide

> **New to Luclin?** Follow this checklist to get started on your lunar adventure!

   - Visit any Wizard Spire location on Norrath
   - Hail the Nexus Scion to receive a Spire Stone
   - Wait for the portal (activates every 15 minutes)

2. **Explore The Bazaar**
   - Stock up on supplies and equipment
   - Set up your own trader if desired
   - Bank is available on both ends

3. **Choose Your Path**
   - **New Character (Vah Shir)**: Start in Shar Vahl
   - **Leveling (10-30)**: Head to Paludal Caverns or Marus Seru
   - **Mid-Level (30-45)**: Try Grimling Forest or Jaggedpine

   - Join a guild and/or join the regular open server raids announced in discord for raid progression

## Vah Shir

The Vah Shir are a race of noble feline people who have resided on Luclin for several hundred years. When the Erudites of Odus went to war, a devastating explosion launched a chunk of the continent into space, taking with it a majority of the Kerran population. 

Trapped on the moon, the survivors adapted to their new environment and grew stronger, forced to make themselves a new home on Luclin in **Shar Vahl**. Over time, their people evolved into the Vah Shir, and are now differentiated from their Kerran ancestors.

> **Racial Identity**: Because of their tumultuous history, even to this day the Vah Shir share incredibly close bonds with one another. A Vah Shir will always put their kin first and exhibits selflessness and unwavering loyalty. Powerful and devoted, a Vah Shir is great to have on your side.
{.is-info}

## Beastlords

Beastlords are masters of raw nature with the unique ability to channel this energy into themselves and their pets. They are always found fighting alongside their loyal companion animals, and can enhance their creature's natural abilities with special spells.

A beastlord is versatile in battle. They can engage in hand-to-hand combat using blunt weapons or their bare hands, or hang back to de-buff enemies and help allies with health or mana regeneration using a variety of spells. Beastlords are valuable individuals to have in a group, but can also hold their own on solo adventures.

**Available to**: Barbarian, Iksar, Ogre, Troll, and Vah Shir

## Travel To and From Luclin

### Getting There

> **Portal Mechanics**: Talking to the Nexus Scion NPC at Wizard Spires will give you a Spire Stone to put in your inventory. These portals activate every **15 minutes** on a continuous timer and will port you **to The Nexus**. The timer is not based upon when you hail the Nexus Scion.

## Exploring Luclin

Luclin is one of two moons that circle around the world of Norrath. Due to the way that it is locked to the world, one side of Luclin is constantly ablaze with direct sunlight while the other half is stuck in a never-ending darkness. Both sides are inhabited by different creatures, and each half has unique experiences to offer.

### Katta Castellum & Sanctus Seru

**Katta Castellum** can be found on the dark side of the moon on the cliffs of the **Tenebrous Mountains** overlooking the **Twilight Sea**. Katta Castellum was the first real city established on Luclin by those who were loyal followers of the Combine Empire. Despite its darkened appearance, the city is full of good-aligned individuals who believe in respecting all people. Pay a visit to Katta Castellum and you’ll find a mass of goods and services, including some exotic items unique to the city.

**Sanctus Seru**, on the other hand, is Katta Castellum’s perfect mirror. Located on the light side of the moon, the city was built by followers of the Inquisition following their transportation to Luclin.  Here, the Praesertum Inquisitors maintain power, and citizens are subject torturous means of control. This has heightened unease within the city, making it an unsafe place full of thieves, spies, and even assassins. If you for some reason decide to pass through the city, you’ll at least be in close range of the **Dawnshroud Peaks**.

### Paladul Caverns

The Paludal Caverns are a system of dense, boggy caves that lie beneath **Hollowshade Moor**. The caverns are filled with funguses and mosses that thrive in the moist environment, and a number of unconventional creatures can be found dwelling within the tunnels. Though the Paludal Caverns are less than glamorous, they can be a great place to explore for newer adventurers who are trying to gain some experience.


The arrangement of the natural tunnels can be somewhat confusing at first, but does provide useful underground paths to **Shadow Haven** and **Shadeweaver’s Thicket**. Occasionally, traders can be found utilizing the caverns for quicker travel between these areas of Luclin. If you find yourself lost within the tunnels, they may be able to help you find a way out.

### The Deep

Amidst the **Echo Caverns** is a series of dangerous and complex caverns known as The Deep. These tunnels are teeming with dangerous creatures, and lead all the way down to the very heart of Luclin. If you decide to venture into the Deep, beware of the large abyss you come across – crossing it is not nearly as simple as it appears, and even successfully doing so will only lead to facing even deadlier threats.

If you manage to survive long enough to make it to the deepest depths of the caverns, you may find a hidden entrance to **Ssraeshza Temple**. This temple belongs to the Shissar and may be one of the most threatening places on all of Luclin. With nearly every risk comes the possibility of great rewards, so it shouldn’t be surprising that many powerful adventurers attempt to brave the temple. Many fail to make it back.

### Vex Thal

A trip to Vex Thal is not for the faint of heart. To even enter the edifice, you must manage to gather an impressive number of lucid shards held by some of the rarest and most powerful creatures on Luclin. If you eventually manage to make your way inside, you’ll face even stronger enemies: the Akheva. High Priestess Aten Ha Ra and her followers certainly will not appreciate your presence in their home.

Those who have visited Vex Thal (and made it out alive) have remarked on its grandeur. The inside of the structure is gorgeous and massive, but it is incredibly easy to find yourself trapped on the inside of its marvelous walls. It could take a massive group of adventurers countless hours to fight their way through the entirety of Vex Thal, but those who succeed will be find themselves inundated with the most handsome of rewards.

### The Bazaar

The Bazaar was specifically built to facilitate trade with the masses of Norrathian adventurers who began to frequent Luclin after convenient travel became available, and has become one of the busiest areas on the entire moon. The area is full of trader’s stalls, vendors, and countless other kiosks including banks on either end to add ease to shopping. It’s a great place to practice tradeskilling, and adventurers are welcome to come to trade their own goods in the Bazaar as well.

Just outside of the Bazaar you can find the Nexus, which is the primary hub for travel between Norrath and Luclin. Though **the Nexus** may seem physically small, the arcane energy that emanates from the area and through the spires is powerful. From this area you can find several tunnels leading out to various parts of Luclin, which makes this area the useful for travel.

### The Grey

**[The Grey](https://www.eqarchives.com/zones/view/thegrey){:target="_blank"}** is a desolate, airless void that serves as a protective barrier for the Shissars. When the Shissars fled to Luclin to escape the Greenmist, they magically sealed this region to create an atmosphere-free zone where the Greenmist could not reach them.

> **Lore Significance**: The Grey represents the lengths the Shissars went to in order to survive. This lifeless expanse stands between the Shissar territories and the rest of Luclin, serving as both protection and prison.

Beyond The Grey lies **Ssraeshza Temple**, the fortress-temple where Emperor Ssraeshza—powerful enough to slay gods according to legend—rules over his people.
