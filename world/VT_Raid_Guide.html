<p>Vex<strong> Thal Raid Quick Guide (credit for initial write-up to EQ progression and Allakhazam, adapted to EQA by Abomination)</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Vex Thal</strong> is the final raid zone in <strong>Shadows of Luclin</strong> expansion. There is a ton of trash. There is even trash that spawns more trash! Mobs here have a lot of HP. Generally, bosses need to be killed in order or we’ll face <strong>Warders</strong> that will Death Touch and/or boot you the room in front of Blob1, where you will die horribly. The <strong>Warders</strong> are scattered throughout the zone and despawn as bosses are killed. We will always clear VT in a way that ensures no interaction with warders. Because of this, and because this zone is so difficult, there are a few ground rules that need to be set in place:<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.) Do not ever leave PC corpses in this zone. If you die exploring or doing something silly, summon your corpse and loot it ASAP. Leaving corpses up breaks up how the CoTH mages target people and makes it impossible to raid normally.</p>
<p>2.) Scheduled raids only. This may be subject to change in the future, but for now, VT bosses will consist of scheduled raids only. This is because of the <strong>Warders</strong> that despawn when bosses are killed - we need accurate times of death on raid bosses in order to make we can schedule raids in a way that doesn't result in <strong>Warders</strong> spawning halfway through the night.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>A Note on Nomenclature</strong><br><br>Each trash mob in Vex Thal has three attributes which affects how the raid handles them:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The first word of its name</li>
  <li>The last word of its name</li>
  <li>It's appearance</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>First Word of Name</strong>&nbsp;<br><br>Eom &gt; Pli &gt; Zun &gt; Zov &gt; Qua, in order of difficulty.</p>
<p>Mobs that have names starting with Qua and Zov are mezzable by enchanters (rapture). These are the only two types of mobs in the entire zone that can be mezzed. Zov's are slightly harder than Qua's but both these mob types are the two least difficult in the zone.</p>
<p>Tanks and offtanks will all need to be assigned for the three remaining types of mobs that are not mezzable. In order from hardest to easiest they are: Eom &gt; Pli &gt; Zun. Warriors will generally try to pick off the Eoms, then knights can focus on the Plis then the Zuns.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Loot note: Eoms have very rare random chance to drop VT bane weapons and items from the Thall Va Xakra loot table. VT bane weapons will be prioritized to DPS classes as NBG rolls.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Last Word of Name&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The last word of the mob's name (Centien, Xakra, etc.) defines its class. It's not important to have the whole list memorized, but it is very important to recognize two types: ___ Thall and ____ Zethon. Thalls are cleric mobs and Zethons are wizard mobs. This is significant because they Gate. Gaters in VT are the most common cause of wipes. Lower mobs like Zov Zethons can be stunned. Until PoP, Eom Thall/Zethon can only be hit with pally AA stun and burned down hard with nukes when it gets into gate mode.</p>
<p><strong>Appearance</strong></p>
<p>Trash mobs in VT have three different looks: shade golems/stonegrabbers, 4-armed fancy robes (like Shei) and 2-armed plain robes (Xi Vius and Xaui in ME).</p>
<p>Fancy robes that look like Shei pop a plain robe on their death on the exact spot they died. The resulting plain robe is always equal to or lower on the mob difficulty list. The thing to note is that caster versions of the spawned plain robes do not Gate as their "bind" point is the place you killed their parent fancy robe.</p>
<p><strong>Tank order priority (highest to lowest)</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>non-mezzable plain robes or Golems (Eom &gt; Pli &gt; Zun)</li>
  <li>non-mezzable fancy robes (Eom &gt; Pli &gt; Zun)</li>
  <li>plain robes that pop out of non-mezzable fancy robes, regardless of whether the pop is mezzable</li>
  <li>mezzable plain robes or Golems (Zov &gt; Qua)</li>
  <li>mezzable fancy robes (Zov &gt; Qua)</li>
</ol>
<p>The average pull in VT is 3-8 mobs at a time in camp, and that is the only way we can really move fast enough to keep up with repops. So not only the main tanks , but all the off-tanks should learn or sticky-note what's mezzable and what is not and learn to be quick about picking out the mobs they have to offtank when a big pull comes in.<br><br>Finally, each boss mob will be identified below. In-game, on discord, and in other chat, their shorthand letter acronym is what is usually used. For example, <strong>Kaas Thox Xi Ans Dyek</strong> is known as <strong>blob 1 </strong>and <strong>Diabo Xi Xin Thall </strong>is known as<strong> DXXT.</strong><br><br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Va Dyn Khar</strong></p>
<p>This boss drops <strong>Palace Key - </strong>The key to the front door. Priority on this key goes to Rogues, then Pullers (Monks, Bards, Shadowknights, Rangers, then Druids, in that order).&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="image"><img src="https://www.eqprogression.com/wp-content/uploads/Vex_Thal_Key/Va-Dyn-Khar-Map.png"></figure>
<ul>
  <li>Hits for 450</li>
  <li>Slowable</li>
  <li>600K HP</li>
  <li>Not a formal boss - Can farm as needed if you want keys, 1 hour 10 minute respawn</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thall Va Xakra</strong></p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://www.eqprogression.com/wp-content/uploads/Raid_Guides/Vex_Thal_Raid/Thall-Va-Xakra.jpg"></figure>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://www.eqprogression.com/wp-content/uploads/Vex_Thal_Key/Va-Xakra-Map.png"></figure>
<p>There are two of these mobs - they do not share loot tables. See map <strong>Red Circles </strong>for the locations. <strong>North Wing Key</strong> drops from the paired <strong>Va Xakra</strong> mobs near these bosses. These bosses are not connected to warders and will be the first available for unscheduled raids after we've established ourselves in the zone.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each <strong>TVX</strong> will be fought at the zone in. Kiters will kite the entire courtyard and then each respective wing (keeping the train size below 30 or so), with pullers pulling out the stonegrabbers and robes as needed to bring to the raid to kill. Once the named are able to be tagged, the pullers will bring them and the two leashed <strong>Va Xakras</strong> to the raid to be killed. Once the adds and then the named are engaged, all the kiters will be cothed. <strong>TVX</strong> calls for help from their wing, and all the robes in that wing will path to the zone in after the named mob dies.</p>
